<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>There is a period in a boy's life, roughly speaking
between the ages of ten and sixteen, when his interests
and energy turn in the direction of making
things. It may be called the creative period, and
with many of us it ends nearer sixty than sixteen.
At one time it will take the form of a mania for
building boats; again it may be automobiles or
aeroplanes.</p>

<p>The boy is very susceptible to suggestion. A
great automobile race occurs, and for weeks the
building and racing of toy automobiles goes on apace.
The papers are filled with accounts of an aero meet.
Immediately the boy's energy turns to the study
and manufacture of aeroplanes. This abounding
interest in the real things of life is perfectly normal
and should be encouraged rather than discouraged;
but the boy needs guidance, if this energy is to be
properly directed. He needs strengthening in his
weak points, otherwise he may become superficial
and "scattering" in his work, and fail to stick to
a thing until, overcoming all obstacles, he succeeds
in doing the one thing he set out to do. He may
acquire the bad habit of never finishing anything,
though continually starting new schemes.</p>

<p>The ability of the average boy is far beyond the
general estimate, but intelligent supervision is
needed. The pocket knife is his natural tool, yet
not one boy out of a thousand realizes its possibilities.
An attempt has been made in this volume to
suggest some of these, especially for boys living in
the city, where a little work shop for himself, unfortunately,
is too often a luxury.</p>

<p>The two boys here depicted form a composite
picture of several thousand American boys whom it
has been the pleasure of the author to guide.</p>

<p>The ability to design new things, and to adapt
general rules to personal requirements, is to be
encouraged at all times, and this idea has been
exemplified in the following pages.</p>

<small>INTRODUCTORY</small></h2>


<p>Two boys sat on a log whittling. Conversation
had ceased and they both seemed
absorbed in their work. Presently the
younger one became aware of the silence and glanced
at the older boy. He gave an exclamation and jumped
to his feet. "Why," he cried, "you are making a knife
out of wood. Isn't it a beauty! Is it a dagger?"</p>

<p>"No" replied the other, "it is a paper-knife
for opening letters and cutting the pages of magazines.
It is for father's desk, for his birthday."</p>

<p>"It's a dandy!" continued the youngster. "How
can you make such fine things? Why can't I do
that kind of work?"</p>

<p>"You can do it," replied Ralph, "but just now
there are several reasons why you don't."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place you start to whittle
without having any clear idea of what you are at
work on. It's for all the world like setting out to
walk without knowing where you are going. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">[4]</a></span>you start that way, the probabilities are that you
will get nowhere, and when you get back and father
asks where you have been, you say, 'Oh, nowhere;
just took a walk.' That's the way with your
knife work. You just whittle and make a lot of
chips, and when you get through you have nothing
to show for your time and labour. If you want to
know a secret&mdash;I never start to cut without first
making a careful sketch of just what I want to
make, with all the important dimensions on it.</p>

<p>"Another reason you don't get any results is that
you don't know how to hold your knife, and still
another is that you work with a dull tool. Why, that
knife of yours is hardly sharp enough to cut butter."</p>

<p>"Will you show me how to do that kind of work?"
asked the youngster humbly.</p>

<p>"Yes; on certain conditions."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"That you will do just as I tell you."</p>

<p>"Will you show me how to make a paper-cutter
now?"</p>

<p>"There you go, right off the handle! You are
like a young man learning carpentry; you want to
start right in to build a house instead of first learning
how to use your tools. Why, it has taken me
two years in the manual training school to learn how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">[5]</a></span>to do this work. No, indeed, if you want to learn
how to do woodwork like this you must begin on
something simple, learn how to handle wood, and
how to keep your tools sharp."</p>

<p>"All right," sighed the younger boy; "I am
willing to take lessons and begin at the beginning.
What shall we do first?"</p>

<p>"The first thing to do is to throw away your
folding penknife. That kind is of very little use.
The steel is so poor it won't hold a cutting edge for
any time at all, and the knife has a treacherous habit
of closing up on your fingers. I will give you a good
Swedish whittling knife like mine, and we will
start by putting a good cutting edge on it."</p>

<p>So the boys began the first lesson. The fun they
had and the things they made, their many experiences,
the patience required, and the great skill
developed with tools are described in the following
pages. What they accomplished, any other boy
may do if he will but apply himself with all his
energy.</p>

<small>FIRST EXPERIMENTS&mdash;THE KNIFE AND ITS
POSSIBILITIES</small></h2>


<p>The older boy, after a search through his
treasure chest, selected a knife with a
blade about two and a half inches long.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the smaller boy caught a glimpse
of the inside of that chest and it made his eyes
bulge&mdash;but that is another story.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig1"></a><img src="images/fig1.jpg" width="600" height="107" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1. The whittling knife</div>
</div>

<p>"This knife," explained Ralph, "is one I used
for over a year in school and it's the most perfectly
shaped tool for whittling that I have ever seen.
Of course knives come in hundreds of shapes for
different purposes, and later on, when you have
become skilled in using this one, we will try some
others, but our first motto must be 'one thing at
a time.' A knife with either blade or handle too
long or too short is awkward, but this one seems to fit
my hand, and undoubtedly will fit yours. Try it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">[7]</a></span>Harry took it and went through the motions
of whittling an imaginary stick.</p>

<p>"Now," said Ralph, "we will go out to the wood
pile and see what we can find. White pine makes
the best wood to start on, because it is usually
straight grained, soft, and free from sap; but it
is getting scarce and expensive, so we must be
economical, as it is a very easy matter to waste
lots of lumber."</p>

<p>After some searching, they found part of a
pine board, about a foot long and an inch thick.
Ralph chopped out a piece with a hatchet
and deftly split it to about an inch and a half
wide. His skill was a revelation to Harry, who
saw that even a hatchet could be used with
precision.</p>

<p>"Now," said Ralph, "I want you to cut this
piece of rough pine to a smooth, straight piece, just
an inch square."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," replied Harry eagerly. "Just
watch me."</p>

<p>"Take care," said Ralph. "I said an inch
square; anything less than an inch will be wrong.
Just imagine that this is a problem in arithmetic
and you are trying to find the answer. If you succeed
in making it just an inch square the answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">[8]</a></span>will be correct; anything larger or smaller than
the exact size will be wrong. In the first place,
hold your knife so that it makes a slant or oblique
angle with the wood, like this (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>)," he said,
taking the wood in his left hand and the knife in
his right. "That gives what we call a paring
action, and is much easier (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) than the stiff way
you were holding it, at right angles with the stick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">[9]</a></span>"Now remember that the trouble with beginners
is that they usually take off too much material.
Make light, easy cuts and try to get one side of
the wood perfectly straight first."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig4"></a><img src="images/fig4.jpg" width="600" height="371" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4. Testing with the try square</div>

</div>

<p>This was a harder job than Harry had expected,
but after much testing and sighting (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>) Ralph
said it would do for the first attempt. "Now," he
said, "you may consider this first side the foundation
of your house. Make a pencil mark on it near one
of the edges, what the woodworker would call his
witness mark. It means that this side or face is
finished and the edge nearest the pencil mark is
to be trued up next."</p>

<p>This proved even a harder job than the first,
because after whittling and testing until he had the
second side straight and true, Ralph tested it with
a square and found that the second edge was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">[10]</a></span>at right angles with the first, or working face. It
was finally straightened, however, to stand the
try square test fairly well.</p>

<p>An inch was next marked off at each end on face
number one, and a sharp pencil line drawn from end
to end. Harry then whittled this third side down
to the line, and tested again with the try square.
It seemed easier to do now, and the thickness was
obtained in the same way. It looked as if they
never would get that piece of pine exactly square,
and even when Ralph said it would do, they measured
it with a rule and found it an eighth of an
inch too small each way.</p>

<p>Harry was disgusted. "The answer is wrong
after all," he exclaimed, "but I'll learn to do that
if it takes me a month."</p>

<p>"That's the right sporting spirit," said Ralph.
"Keep at it till you get it. It's the hardest thing
you will ever have to do with a knife, and it's
unfortunate that you have to tackle it the first
thing; but it's like learning to play the piano,
you must learn the notes and scales and how to use
your fingers before you can play a real piece. Every
time you try this, you are gaining skill and the
control of your hands. After a while you will be
able to do it easily and think nothing of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">[11]</a></span>Several days later Harry brought in a piece
that he had been working on and Ralph tested it
carefully with rule and try square. He gave Harry
a pat on the back. "Good for you, boy; you are
coming along splendidly," he said. "How many of
these have you tried?"</p>

<p>"Twenty," said Harry meekly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig5"></a><img src="images/fig5.jpg" width="600" height="139" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5. The notched trophy stick</div>

</div>

<p>"Well, now, I'll show you how the Indians used
to record their exploits. We'll put a notch on this
stick for every one you've tried to make, and you
can keep it as a souvenir of your first attempts
at whittling." So with great care they measured
off six two-inch spaces on each edge, carefully drew
notches with a pencil and rule, and as carefully cut
each notch to the line. (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5.</a>)</p>

<p>Harry was delighted with the result.</p>

<p>They then hunted up a small screw eye, found the
exact centre of the end of the stick by drawing two
diagonals, fastened the screw eye in the centre and
tied to it a piece of red, white and blue ribbon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">[12]</a></span>A quarter-inch bevel was made around each end
as a finishing touch.</p>

<p>This piece of white pine, with its twenty notches,
hangs to-day in Harry's room, and every once in
awhile he counts the notches to make sure they are all
there, and recalls the trial that each one represents.</p>

<p>Harry was so much pleased with his notched
trophy stick that he wanted to begin something else at
once, and he was immediately started on a key rack.</p>

<p>"Too many homes," said Ralph, sagely, "have no
definite place to keep keys. Those that have no
tags are always a nuisance. Every key or bunch
of keys should have a tag attached and should be
hung on a certain hook where it can be found
without searching. Now we'll make a sketch of
a key rack before doing anything else, to find out
just how large a piece of stick we shall need."</p>

<p>The drawing they produced is shown in <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>
and called for a piece of wood seven inches long,
an inch wide, and half an inch thick. As the key
rack was to be a permanent household article, they decided
on gum wood as more suitable than pine, it being
easy to work and having a satisfactory appearance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">[13]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig6"></a><img src="images/fig6.jpg" width="600" height="831" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6. The various steps in making a key rack</div>

</div>

<p>The different stages in the process of cutting
out are shown in <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>. At <i>a</i> is shown the stock
squared up with the knife to the extreme outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">[14]</a></span>dimensions. The ends were then whittled down to
the form shown at <i>b</i> and the blank piece was ready
for notching. The notches were carefully drawn
with a sharp hard pencil and cut as shown at <i>c</i>.
The ends were bevelled by whittling to the lines, and
the inner edges of the notches in the centre were
whittled back to the middle of each edge. Then the
knife work was finished.</p>

<p>Three brass screw hooks were placed in the centre
of the large blank spaces, and two small screw eyes
fastened into the upper edge for hanging the key
rack on the wall.</p>

<p>Each stage of the work had been worked out so
carefully that the boys hardly realized what a satisfactory
result they were getting. When it was
finally hung in the boys' room, of course some keys
must be put on it, and as they had no tags, the
making of some followed as a matter of course.
A search through their small stock of woods
disclosed a few little pieces of holly, the remains
of fret saw work, about an eighth of an inch
thick. This proved to be ideal material, and half
a dozen key tags were made of the size and
shape shown in <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>. The holes were made
with a brad awl, the tags fastened to the rings
by small pieces of wire, and the names of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">[15]</a></span>keys printed on the different tags with black drawing
ink.</p>

<a id="fig7"></a><img src="images/fig7.jpg" width="200" height="423" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 7. The key tag</div>

</div>

<p>The boys, from this time on, seemed possessed with
a mania for making articles to be used about the
house. One thing to be manufactured
without delay was a winder for their
fishing lines.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="fig8"></a><img src="images/fig8.jpg" width="200" height="449" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 8. Fish line winder</div>

</div>

<p>The form they finally decided on is
shown in <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>. Ralph insisted on the
design being carefully drawn on a piece
of thin wood, a quarter of an inch thick.
Harry found whittling to curved lines
somewhat harder than notching, but
he produced a fairly satisfactory result.
Ralph was a very exacting teacher,
always having in mind his own training
in school. He showed Harry how
to cut out the curves at the ends without
cutting his thumb (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9.</a>) and
gave him much advice about whittling
away from himself, whenever possible.</p>

<p>When the knife work was finished,
Ralph explained that where curved
edges were cut it was allowable to
smooth with a piece of fine sand-paper, although
as a rule it was to be avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<a id="fig9"></a><img src="images/fig9.jpg" width="599" height="476" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 9. Cutting concave curves</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">[16]</a></span>Harry wanted to know why, and Ralph explained
that, generally speaking, sand-paper was the hallmark
of a poor workman, one who could not do
good work with his tools. Sand-paper leaves a
scratched surface, for the grit becomes embedded
in the wood to a certain extent, and it will immediately
ruin the cutting edge of a sharp tool in case
one has to be used after the sand-papering. "So,"
he summed up, "keep your sand-paper and knife
as far apart as possible."</p>

<p>About this time the ladies of the household
thought that a winder for worsted would come in
very handy, and the boys evolved a new form, shown
in <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>. This was made only an eighth of
an inch thick, and proved so easy of construction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">[17]</a></span>that each of the boys made two and "allowed" that
"they ought to satisfy the sewing department for
some time to come."</p>

<a id="fig10"></a><img src="images/fig10.jpg" width="200" height="193" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 10. The worsted winder</div>

</div>

<p>"Do you know," exclaimed Harry
one day, "we could make lots of
things for Christmas and birthday
presents!"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said Ralph,
"and people appreciate things that
you have made yourself much more than things
you buy. Anybody can go to the store and
buy ready-made presents, but those you make
yourself mean more."</p>

<p>"In what way?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"Why, they represent much more of your
time and labour, and thought; and, by the
way, if we are going to make many Christmas
presents, we must start right away, because we
only have a few weeks and you know how little
time we have outside of school hours after getting
our lessons."</p>

<p>The result of this talk was that the little building
in the yard which they called their "shop" became
a perfect beehive of industry for several weeks.
With what money they had saved they purchased
a supply of lumber and a few tools the use of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">[18]</a></span>Ralph said he would explain later. He suggested
that Harry begin by making some calendar backs,
as suitable New Year's
presents, because they
were easy; and the more
complicated articles could
be made after Harry had
developed a little more
skill with the knife.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig11"></a><img src="images/fig11.jpg" width="300" height="343" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 11. First calendar back</div>

</div>

<p>The drawing he made
is shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>. This
called for a small calendar
about two inches long,
an inch and three quarters high, and a space
this size was drawn on the centre of the calendar
back, while the calendar
was glued to the wood.</p>

<a id="fig12"></a><img src="images/fig12.jpg" width="300" height="298"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 12. Second calendar back</div>

</div>

<p>After two or three of these
had been made, Harry decided
that they were too
small to suit him, and a
new design somewhat larger
was worked out on
paper. It was a little more
difficult to follow, because
the outline had two reversed curves, but the boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">[19]</a></span>were too busy and interested to be daunted by a
trifle like that. (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>.)</p>

<p>Ralph suggested simple picture frames, and this
brought the new problem of cutting out an opening
for the picture.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig13"></a><img src="images/fig13.jpg" height="328" width="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13. Picture frame with elliptical opening</div>

</div>

<p>The first design they tried is shown in <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>.
Ralph had to show Harry how to make the ellipse
with compasses by first constructing two squares
or rectangles touching, and with both diagonal
lines in each square. By taking for a centre the
point where the squares touch, as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and using
the length of a diagonal
line as a radius, two arcs
were drawn at <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
The ellipse was finished
by taking <i>c</i> as a centre,
and the distance <i>c d</i> as a
radius, to draw arc <i>z</i>, and
the other end was finished
in the same way.</p>

<p>Ralph explained that
this was not a perfect
ellipse, but would answer for a small picture
frame. The drawing was easy compared to the
question of how to cut out the wood to this curved
line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig14"></a><img src="images/fig14.jpg" width="600" height="519" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 14. Using the coping saw</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">[20]</a></span>One of the new tools was brought out, and Harry
was introduced to the mysteries of the coping saw.
(<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>). A thin saw blade was produced and
fastened in one end of the frame, the other end being
left free. A hole was made inside of the ellipse with
a brad awl, the free end of the blade passed through
the opening and fastened in the frame of the saw.
Resting the picture frame on the edge of a bench,
the ellipse was sawed out roughly about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  of an
inch inside of the drawing. This remaining sixteenth
of an inch was then whittled to the line with
a knife and finished with sand-paper. Harry found
some difficulty in getting this elliptical opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">[21]</a></span>smooth enough to suit him, so they tried designing
for half an hour, and produced a new form (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig15"></a><img src="images/fig15.jpg" width="600" height="684" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 15. Picture frame in straight lines</div>

</div>

<p>This was easier, as there were no curved lines, and
it could be sawed close to the outside as well as
the inside lines, to save time in whittling. While
Harry was finishing this frame, Ralph was busy on
a new design and finally passed over the drawing
shown in <a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">[22]</a></span>"Do you know there is as much fun
in getting up new designs as there is in making
them in wood?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have to
know how to draw," replied
the younger boy.
"Can't you teach me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I first make a rough
sketch of my idea, and then
a careful drawing of its
actual size, with the drawing
instruments."</p>

<p>"That's the part that I want to learn: how to
use the instruments."</p>

<p>A lesson in mechanical drawing followed, and as
it is a very important subject to young woodworkers,
it will be given in full in the next chapter.</p>

<small>MECHANICAL DRAWING</small></h2>


<p>"In taking up mechanical drawing," said
Ralph, "always remember that accurate and
neat work, containing all necessary dimensions,
is half the battle. You will probably feel, as I did at
first, that it is a waste of time, but you can always consider
that when your drawing is finished the work
is half done. You can judge from it the number of
pieces of stock required, and their over-all dimensions
This saves much time at the wood pile, and
tells at a glance to just what size you must square
up each piece of stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">[24]</a></span>"The drawing board is an absolute necessity. It
need not be perfectly square, but the surface must
be flat and true, and at least one of the edges absolutely
straight. (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>.) The T square must have
a thin blade&mdash;about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  of an inch, and be made of
hard wood. It should form a right angle with the
head, which slides along the left-hand edge of the
drawing board, and that must be the straight
edge.</p>

<p>"The T square is used as a guide for the pencil
in drawing horizontal lines, and it should always be
kept on the same side of the drawing board. When
drawing a vertical line, one of the wooden triangles
should be placed on the T square and the line
drawn along the left-hand edge of the triangle.
Circles or arcs of circles are drawn with the compasses
held at the extreme top."</p>

<p>With this introduction, the boys proceeded to
fasten with four thumb-tacks a piece of drawing
paper to the upper part of the drawing board.</p>

<p>"Why don't you put the paper in the centre?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Because, if one worked on the lower part of the
drawing board, the T square head would extend
below the edge of the board, and touch the table.
You would have to watch it constantly. The head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">[25]</a></span>of the T square should always be tight against the
board, for when you slide it too far down, it sometimes
strikes the table without your knowing it,
and you find your horizontal lines are <i>not</i> horizontal;
so I always like to have the drawing paper as high
up on the board as possible."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 18. Blocking out the crosses of St. Andrew and St. George</div>
</div>

<p>The boys agreed that while the younger was
learning to make drawings, each one should represent
something to be made later in wood. Drawing
number one was a square, 3 inches on a side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">[26]</a></span>Ralph showed how this was made with only two
measurements. Drawing one horizontal and one
vertical line, 3 inches were marked off on each, the
other two lines drawn through these new points,
and the square was finished. Ralph insisted that
all lines be very light, as they could be darkened
up later, if necessary, and were easy to erase in
case of a mistake. (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>.)</p>

<p>Harry was then told to divide the upper and left-hand
sides into even inches, and to draw across the
square vertical and horizontal lines from the four
points obtained.</p>

<p>Thus the large square was subdivided into nine
1-inch squares, and by darkening the lines shown in
the figure at <i>a</i> the cross of St. George was produced.</p>

<p>Another 3-inch square was drawn, and marked
off, as shown at <i>b</i>. The points were connected by
oblique lines by means of the 45-degree triangle,
and by darkening the lines shown at <i>c</i> the cross of
St. Andrew was formed. After explaining that the
British flag was a combination of these two figures
Ralph said, "While we are drawing crosses, we may
as well make a Maltese one."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 19. The Maltese cross</div>

</div>

<p>Starting with a 3-inch square again, it was
measured off as shown in <a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>. The lines
were connected and darkened, as shown at <i>b</i>. "Now,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">[27]</a></span>said Ralph, "you can cut that out of wood, tie a
ribbon on it and wear it as a medal."</p>

<p>"Huh," grunted Harry. "Pretty big medal&mdash;three
inches across!"</p>

<p>"Well, make it any size,
an inch or even less."</p>

<p>"That's not a bad idea.
I'll make it out of white
holly, and put a red, white,
and blue bow on it."</p>

<p>"And print on it 'American
Order of Junior Woodworkers'."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea either; we
can find lots of boys who would
be glad to join and come here
Saturdays to work in the shop."</p>

<p>"There would be no trouble to
get candidates; the trouble would
be to take care of them. They
would fill the yard and overflow into the street,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"But why couldn't we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come now, let's do one thing at a time; you are supposed
to be learning mechanical drawing. We'll leave
the organization of the A. O. J. W. till another time.
I'm going to show you how to use the compasses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">[28]</a></span>While they were drawing the circle, quarterfoil,
heart, and oval, shown in <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>, Ralph reviewed
his pupil on the meaning of diameter, radius, circumference,
etc. "If you want to cut hearts out
of paper or wood, I would advise you to wait until
St. Valentine's Day, and reserve the oval or egg
until Easter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig20"></a><img src="images/fig20.jpg" width="400" height="404" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 20</div>
</div>

<p>"The circle is a wonderful figure. By marking the
radius off on the circumference,
with the
compasses, we find
that the former divides
the latter into
exactly six equal
parts, and by connecting
the points,
we have a perfect
hexagon. By connecting
the alternate
points we obtain a perfect equilateral triangle,
and by connecting the remaining points we
get another triangle of the same size. The two
triangles form a six-pointed star. (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>.)</p>

<p>"Now," said Ralph, "I am going to give you a
problem by dictation; all you have to do is to obey
orders. First draw a circle 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches in diameter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">[29]</a></span>"What's the radius?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"That's for you to find out."</p>

<p>Harry thought a moment, divided three and a
half by two, and setting his compasses at 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> , drew
the circle.</p>

<p>"Now divide the circumference into three equal
parts."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig21"></a><img src="images/fig21.jpg" width="600" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 21. Triangle, hexagon and star</div>

</div>

<p>The boy puzzled over this for a moment, then
marked off the radius, cutting the circumference
into six parts, as if for a hexagon, and erased every
other point, leaving three.</p>

<p>"Draw radial lines from these points to the
centre."</p>

<p>"Easy," remarked Harry, and drew a line from
each point to the centre with the edge of one of his
triangles.</p>

<p>"Find the centre of each of those lines."</p>

<p>"Easy again," said the boy, as he set his compasses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">[30]</a></span>at <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  of an inch, and from the centre of the circle
cut each of the straight lines with an arc. (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>.)</p>

<p>"Draw a semicircle from each of these points
with a radius of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  of an inch."</p>

<p>"Easier still," quoth Harry, as he drew the semicircles.
The drawing then looked like <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 22. Pulley design</div>

</div>

<p>"Now," said the teacher, "let me show you something."
He made a few strokes with the compasses,
and the drawing as shown at <i>b</i> was finished.
"That is enough for to-day. The compasses are
about the easiest of all instruments to use, provided
you keep in mind that the pencil point needs to be
sharpened to a chisel, or flat shape, the same as any
other drawing pencil. The number of designs
which may be made with it are simply endless,
as you will learn later on."</p>

<small>MECHANICAL DRAWING: <span class="smcap">Continued</span></small></h2>


<p>The next day, as they were about to resume
their study, Ralph said: "There is so much
to drawing that I hardly know where to
begin, or what to leave out; but in shop drawing, a
picture will not do; imagine an architect trying to
build a skyscraper from a picture. The shop drawing
must tell the mechanic everything he needs to
know about the object he is making. He cannot
keep running to the office asking questions; the drawing
must answer them all. That is the reason why the
draughting-room is such an important part of every
manufacturing plant. Drawing is the language the
designer uses to tell the workmen what he wants made.
It is doubly important when the designer is hundreds
or thousands of miles away from the workman.</p>

<p>"A battle-ship can be designed in Australia and
built in England, so this language of the shop has
grown to be a very interesting and important art.
Every one who works with tools must learn it sooner
or later, the sooner the better.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 23. Front and top views</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">[32]</a></span>"Usually it is necessary to represent even the
simplest object by at least two views. For example,
suppose I hand you
this sketch <i>a</i> (Fig.
23), and tell you
to make two out of
wood. You wouldn't
know what to do
because no thickness
is shown, but if I give you this sketch <i>b</i>, you
would see immediately that it has practically no
thickness and might be a sheet of paper. You learn
that from the top view looking down on it.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 24. Showing necessity for top view</div>

</div>

<p>"The first view is called the front view. Now,
suppose I change the top view to this <i>c</i>; thickness
is shown here, and if I say, make two of these
out of white pine, you would know all that would
be necessary to go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">[33]</a></span>
"Again, suppose I give you this sketch <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>),
and ask you to make two out of gum wood.
You would be completely at sea, because that front
view might have any one of these top views shown
at <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>). In other words, it might be
a triangle without thickness, a wedge, cone, or
pyramid.</p>

<p>"So you see, two views are absolutely necessary,
and very often a third, taken from the right or left
side. The three views of a book would look like
<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>. The side view is not necessary in this case,
but that is the way it
would be drawn if a
third were needed.
You will have plenty
of opportunities for
practising this as we
get along with our
tool work, because in
order to understand
drawings you must
be able to make
them. Suppose you
try your hand now,
by drawing the two views of a cylinder, two inches
in diameter and three inches high."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">[34]</a></span>Ralph rolled a sheet of paper up until the ends
met, to illustrate a cylinder, and the drawing produced

<p>"Now," said Ralph, "no shop drawing is complete
unless it shows all the necessary dimensions;
so I will put them on to show you how it is done,
but after this you must dimension every drawing
you make."</p>

<p>The finished drawing of the cylinder is shown
at <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Harry was told to make the mechanical drawing
of a cone, 2 inches in diameter, and 3 inches high.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">[35]</a></span>While he was working at this problem, Ralph disappeared,
and when he returned Harry asked where
he had been.</p>

</div>

<p>"Never mind. Let me see your drawing,"
<i>c</i> (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>). "All right." Then he laid a little
wooden object on the table.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a cat," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, a tip cat, and as soon as you make a working
drawing of it, you are going to manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">[36]</a></span>one with your knife. Please notice that the tip
cat is a cylinder with a cone at each end, and two
views will show everything about it."</p>

<p>The drawing took longer to make than Harry
imagined it would; or it seemed longer because he
was so impatient to get to work with his knife. His
finished drawing is shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>).</p>

<p>The different stages in the making of the tip cat
are shown in <a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 28. Second tip cat</div>

</div>

<p>First came the squaring up, shown at <i>a</i>. Then
the two ends were whittled down to wedges as
shown at <i>b</i>, and these two ends reduced to square
pyramids, as at <i>c</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">[37]</a></span>Lines a quarter of an inch from each edge were
drawn on the four sides of the square part and continued
out to the points of the pyramids, as at <i>d</i>.
Cutting to this line changed the square to an octagon,
and the square pyramids to octagonal ones.</p>

<p>The edges were again whittled off until there were
no more to be seen; the cat was smoothed with sand-paper,
and called finished.</p>

<p>Harry was delighted, but Ralph said: "That is
not the best form for a tip cat, because it will roll.
We will make a bat for it now, and after we have
played with it awhile, we'll make a better one; just
the same except that the centre part will be left
square and only the ends rounded." (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p>The bat they made is shown in <a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>. Its
handle was cut out with the coping saw and whittled
to the lines. Ralph explained that anything to
be held should be rounded, or it would be hard on
the hand, so all the edges were curved with the knife
and finished with sand-paper.</p>

<p>They had so much fun with the cat and bat that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">[38]</a></span>woodwork was forgotten for two afternoons. The
third day it rained, so the boys were glad to get at
work again in the shop.</p>

<p>Ralph suggested that, as they were doing so much
drawing, it might be well to make a pencil sharpener.</p>

<p>The drawing they produced is shown in <a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>.
This was easily worked out in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch wood with a
piece of sand-paper glued in the oblong space.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 30. Pencil sharpener</div>

<p>The sand-paper suggested match scratchers, and
as they are useful articles, several designs were
worked up for Christmas gifts. Three of these
are shown in <a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>, but after a good deal of
discussion it was decided that for scratching
matches a longer space for sand-paper was necessary,
and three other designs (<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>) were the
result of several hours' work.</p>

<p>"Very well, we'll get ready for Santa Claus, and
provide a stock of things for our numerous young

chance to use our coping saw, and I have been
wanting to do that for a long time."</p>

<small>TOYS</small></h2>


<p>"In making presents for little children," said Ralph,
"we must always remember that the toys will be
played with and receive a great deal of rough
handling. So to begin with, they must be strong and
of simple construction. The youngsters don't care so
much for finely finished articles as older people do,
and they tire very quickly of things that are so complicated
that they get out of order easily. Suppose
we first make some neat boxes. They can be
filled with candy, and after that is gone they will
be used for a long time to keep treasures in."</p>

<p><a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a> shows the drawing of the first box the
boys made. The two oblong pieces form the top
and bottom. The latter was nailed on with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
brads. The two cleats were nailed to the under side
of the top to hold it in place, while the sides and
ends were fastened with a little glue, and one brad
in the centre. This made a very serviceable box,
the material being basswood <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  of an inch thick.</p>

<p>The sled shown in <a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> came next, made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041">[41]</a></span>the same material as the box. Ralph was delighted
with its strength and graceful lines. Two cleats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">[42]</a></span>were glued into the grooves in the sides, and the
top nailed on with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brads.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 34. The toy sled</div>

</div>

<p>In each case the drawing was made directly
on the wood, which was sawed close to the lines
with the coping saw, and finished to the lines with
the knife.</p>

<p>The dog house (<a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a>) brought out some new
features of construction. The opening in front
was cut out with the saw and finished as usual.
Sides and ends were then put together with glue.
The two pieces forming the roof were nailed together
with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brads, to make a right angle
and were then placed in position and nailed to the
front and back pieces.</p>

<p>Ralph explained that it was a saving of time and
trouble to draw a light pencil line to mark the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">[43]</a></span>location of the brads. If this is not done, the brads
are apt to come out in the wrong place and will
then have to be withdrawn and placed again. This
is a waste of time and it very often spoils the looks
of the work, so that the drawing of the pencil lines
really saves time in the end, and the lines can be
erased.</p>

<p>"We can make any amount of this dolls' furniture,"
said Ralph. "In fact we could build a doll's
house and equip it with chairs, tables, and beds, but
what the youngsters really like best is something
that works, something that moves, so I move&mdash;no
pun intended&mdash;that we design a toy that has
some life to it. We can cut it out with the coping
saw and there need not be a great deal of knife
work to it. Suppose we make an Indian paddling
a canoe!" This was more of a problem than they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">[44]</a></span>bargained for, as it was necessary to look through an
encyclop&aelig;dia to find pictures of canoes, Indians,
tomahawks, etc. Harry traced the
figure of an Indian chief, transferred
it to the surface of a piece of
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch basswood, and on sawing
it out found that he had a very
good silhouette of an Indian, but
it did not move (<a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>). The
problem was still unsolved, and
experiments along that line used
up several afternoons.</p>

<p>What was finally worked out is shown in <a href="#fig37">Fig.
37</a>. The arms were made separate from the body,
and were fastened to both the paddles and the bodies
by brads, which acted as pivots. The bodies were
then fastened to the canoe in the same way, but a
little glue was used as well as brads, as they were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">[45]</a></span>
be immovable. How to make the paddlers move
in unison was a hard problem, finally solved by
fastening a narrow strip of wood to the lower part
of each paddle. It was found that by moving this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">[46]</a></span>
strip back and forth the two figures moved with
the precision of a machine. In each case where a
pivot was required it seemed only necessary to
drive in a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brad. (<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>.)</p>

<p>The success of this moving toy was so great that
the boys went rushing into the house to show it to
the family.</p>

<p>Soon they came rushing back again, determined
to try their skill on something else. Ralph had to
remind Harry that the Indian paddlers were not
yet finished, as the toy would not stand up, so the
standards shown at <i>b</i> were sawed out, smoothed
with the knife, and one fastened at each end, as a
support, by means of brads and glue.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 39. The fencers</div>

</div>

<p>After much boyish arguing, it was decided next
to try two swordsmen fencing. This called for
some posing, and looking in books to get the correct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">[47]</a></span>position of a man fencing. The drawing shown in
<a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a> was finally copied from a book on athletic
sports.</p>

<p>The different parts of the figures are shown clearly
in the illustration. It was found, by experimenting
with paper figures, that by making one leg of each
figure in two parts, the body, arms, and other leg
could be sawed out of one piece.</p>

<p>The work of cutting out and assembling this
combination, seemed much easier now that the boys
had gotten into the swing of it, and they were so
anxious to see it work that they almost spoiled
it in their haste. The swords, or foils, were made
of two pieces of soft iron wire.</p>

<p>Ralph insisted on filing these out flat near the
ends to make them look realistic, and they were
fastened by drilling a hole in each hand, passing the
wire through and clinching it with a pair of pliers.
It was much safer to drill these holes, as a brad awl
sometimes splits wood that is very thin. This combination
worked to perfection, and while they were
trying it Harry caught a glimpse of its shadow on
the table. The silhouette in black looked even more
realistic than the toy itself, and it gave the boys
an idea. (<a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>.)</p>

<p>These toys could be used for moving shadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">[48]</a></span>pictures, and immediately their imagination began
to conjure up the programme of a show.</p>

<p>"Our first selection, ladies and gentlemen, will
be a shadow picture, entitled 'Before the Coming
of the White Men'," exclaimed Harry, moving
the Indian paddlers.</p>

<p>"And our next will be entitled 'The Duel',"
said Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">[49]</a></span>"Not a very good historical show," said Harry.
"We ought to have the 'Landing of the <i>Mayflower</i>'."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea, either," said Ralph. "I think
we could rig up a ship in a storm. Let's try that
next."</p>

<small>MOVING TOYS</small></h2>


<p>The problem of making a ship roll proved
somewhat of a strain on the engineering
corner of Ralph's brain, and after awhile
Harry grew restless.</p>

<p>"Can't you give me something to do while you
are designing that ocean?" he said.</p>

<p>Ralph, pausing a moment, replied, "Yes, try two
men sawing a log."</p>

<p>Harry began to draw, but found that he knew
very little about saws, so had to go out and look
at one, measured it, and after awhile produced the
sketch shown in <a href="#fig41">Fig. 41</a>. Ralph criticised it
rather severely, suggesting the addition of a log
and saw buck, and advised that the arms of the
men and saw be cut out of one piece. The drawing
shows the separated pieces, two bodies, four legs,
a saw and arms in one piece, two straight pieces for
the saw buck, the log, and a little triangular piece
to go between log and saw buck. The object of
this triangle is to leave a space between the log
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">[51]</a></span>and saw buck for the passage of the saw back and
forth, as shown in the sectional view.</p>

<p>The two pieces forming the buck were halved
together, and the log, triangle, and buck are fastened
with glue and two brads.</p>

<a id="fig41"></a><img src="images/fig41.jpg" width="599" height="477" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41. The sawyers</div>

</div>

<p>After all the pieces had been cut out, the men
were first put together by fastening both legs to the
body with one <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brad.</p>

<p>The feet were next fastened to the straight piece,
10 inches long, representing the ground, by one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">[52]</a></span>brad through each foot, the bodies standing upright,
and the feet two inches apart. The arms
came next, with one brad through each man's
shoulder, and lastly, the saw buck, with the log
already fastened rigidly to it, was nailed on the back
of the ground piece with the log in front of the saw.
To make this toy stand up, two standards were
fastened to the ends of the ground piece, the same
size as those attached to the fencers in <a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>.</p>

<p>It took Harry two hours to make this figure in
wood, after he had the drawing finished. In the
meantime Ralph had worked out a scheme for
giving a boat a rolling motion.</p>

<p>"We'll be mechanical engineers by the time we
finish this," he told Harry. "This piece of
mechanism calls for a crank, a shaft, two bearings,
and a cam, not to mention a ship, an ocean, and a
few miscellaneous articles too trivial to mention."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig42"></a><img src="images/fig42.jpg" width="600" height="747" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 42. Boat in storm</div>

</div>

<p>The various parts of "the ship in a heavy sea"
are shown in <a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>. At <i>a</i> is the cam, at <i>b</i>
the crank and handle, and at <i>c</i> the shaft. The
boat was sketched free hand and cut out with the
coping saw in one piece by sawing exactly on the
lines. The ocean was represented by two pieces
corresponding to the ground piece in the sawyers,
and the wavy outline was not made until every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">[54]</a></span>thing
had been cut out and the combination was
ready for assembling.</p>

<p>The most difficult part&mdash;the shaft&mdash;was made
first, and entirely with the knife: A piece of basswood
was cut exactly a quarter of an inch square,
a section was marked in the centre of this <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch
wide, and notches were made on each corner. The
two ends were then whittled to an octagonal shape
and rounded. The square section in the centre was
reduced to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch wide and the rounded ends
sand-papered smooth.</p>

<p>Next, the cam was cut out, and the square hole
made. This was accomplished, after spoiling one,
by drilling a quarter of an inch hole in the square
and cutting the opening square with the point of
the knife.</p>

<p>The object of the square opening was to prevent
the cam from slipping when in operation. The cam
was then placed over the round part of the shaft
and glued to the square section, over which it
fitted snugly. Next came the crank. This was
made the same shape as the cam, but the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch
hole drilled in one end was left round, while the
other was cut square as in the cam. The shaft
fitted into the round hole and was glued in after
the assembling. For the handle on the crank, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">[55]</a></span>piece <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch square was fitted into the square hole,
and the rest of it whittled round and sand-papered.</p>

<p>Two cleats, 2 inch &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch, were cut out
with the saw and everything was ready for assembling.
The two sides of the ocean were held together
and the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole at <i>d</i> drilled through
both pieces at once.</p>

<p>The two notches at <i>e</i> were cut after the assembling
was finished. After the holes were drilled,
the wavy line was sawed, and the two ends of the
shaft inserted in the holes with the cam inside.</p>

<p>The two cleats were inserted in the ends of the
ocean and fastened with brads and glue.</p>

<p>Next, the boat was slipped in between the two
sides, with the sloping stern just touching the cam,
and a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brad was driven through the three
thicknesses, sides and boat.</p>

<p>The crank was next slipped over the shaft and
glued in position. The crank handle was inserted
into the square hole and fastened with glue, and
lastly a light rubber band was slipped over the notch
on the stern of the boat and the two corresponding
notches on the bottom of the ocean. This was to
hold the boat against the cam, which gives the
motion.</p>

<p>To make this toy more realistic, the boys got out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">[56]</a></span>a box of water colors, painted the body of the boat
black, the ocean green, and left the basswood sails
their natural color&mdash;white.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 43. Turkey and executioner</div>

</div>

<p>"There," said Ralph when it was finished, "the
youngsters can raise a storm at any time they like
by simply turning the crank. This toy ought to
be very serviceable, as it can't very well get out
of order and is almost unbreakable."</p>

<p>The subject of moving toys is almost endless,
being limited only by the imagination of the designer.
Thanksgiving suggested the turkey and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">[57]</a></span>the axe, and in the toy these boys worked out the
turkey evades the axe every time.</p>

<p>The parts are shown in <a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>. The legs of the
turkey are stuck rigidly to the body by brads and a
little glue, and they are fastened to the ground
piece by one brad, which acts as a pivot.</p>

<p>The axeman's body and right leg are in one piece,
the left leg being in two pieces. The arms adhere
rigidly to the body, and the axe to the hands, by
means of brads. The operating strip is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch
wide and 9 inches long.</p>

<p>It is fastened between the legs of the turkey, and
to the rigid leg of the man, by one brad for pivot
in each case.</p>

<p>The stump is nailed to the ground strip from the
front.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br /><br />
<small>DESIGNING MOVING TOYS</small></h2>


<p>The boys found this making of toys so fascinating
that one was barely finished before
another was suggested. So absorbed
did they become that even meals were forgotten,
and they regarded it as a hardship to be called in
to supper, while to be told that it was bedtime
was absolute cruelty. They found that it saved
time to be systematic, and the usual method of
procedure was about as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig44"></a><img src="images/fig44.jpg" width="600" height="682" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 44. The boxers</div>

</div>

<p>First, to decide on the practicability of the idea.
Second, to sketch out a skeleton figure, as in <i>a</i>
(<a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>), the boxers. When the proper action
was secured in these skeleton figures, the bodies
were sketched roughly around them as shown at <i>b</i>.
Third, the movement of the figures was thought
out, and separate drawings traced from the
assembled drawing on tracing paper. Fourth, these
separate pieces were traced on <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch basswood
with the grain of the wood running the long way
of the piece, wherever it was possible. Fifth, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">[59]</a></span>pieces were sawed out, and the edges smoothed
with knife and sand-paper. Very often, through
anxiety to see how it worked, the smoothing of
the edges was neglected. Sixth, the parts were
put together with brads, and where the points came
through they were bent over or "clinched" on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">[60]</a></span>further side. Seventh, after experiments to discover
the best position for it, the moving strip was
fastened to the legs by <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brads, and last of
all the feet were pivoted to the ground piece in the
same way.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 45. The boxers assembled</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">[61]</a></span>The boys learned many things not to do: for
example, all the finer details of the face and hands
must be omitted, as they are very apt to be broken
off in sawing. It was found best to make the feet
nearly round or the brads would split the wood.
For that reason wherever a brad has to be driven
through, the arm or leg should be made larger than
the proportionate size.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 46. The racing automobile</div>

</div>

<p>The most surprising feature about the figures
was the fact that the shadow they cast on a white
wall or sheet was more realistic than the figures
themselves, and our boys never tired of exercising
these toys in order to watch the shadow pictures.</p>

<p>Of all combinations, perhaps the design and construction
of a racing automobile, that would actually
go, gave them the greatest amount of amusement as
well as the largest number of problems to solve.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">[62]</a></span>The history of trials and failures need not be
given, but the machine, as finished, is shown in
<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>. The body and hood are comparatively
simple. The principal trouble, as with larger
machines, was with the motive power, and the
boys finally compromised by using a rubber
band. The four wheels were sawed out of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch
basswood, and smoothed with sand-paper, the two
driving wheels for the rear having a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole
drilled to receive the ends of the axle. The rear
axle was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch square at the centre for half an
inch, and the rest of it <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch in diameter, rounded
with the knife and sand-paper. The total length
of the axle was four inches, and the wheel base seven
and one-half inches.</p>

<p>For the driving gear, three disks shown at <i>a</i>
(<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>) were sawed out, the two large ones, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches in diameter, from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch basswood. The
edges of these two were rounded with knife and
sand-paper. The small disk, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch in diameter,
was cut from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch wood or two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch pieces
placed together and glued.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig47"></a><img src="images/fig47.jpg" width="600" height="742" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 47. Pieces of racing automobile</div>

</div>

<p>A square hole was cut through the centre of each
of these disks with a knife, and they were then put
together with glue and brads, making a very serviceable
grooved pulley, which was slipped over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">[63]</a></span>shaft and fitted over the square part in the centre.
As it was a snug fit no glue was necessary, and the
square part prevented the pulley from slipping on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">[64]</a></span>the shaft. The forward axle was made 3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches
long, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  of an inch square, except at the ends,
where for a distance of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch it was rounded,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch in diameter. This completed the wheels,
axles, and transmission pulley.</p>

<p>The chassis, or frame, which supports the body,
consists of two pieces of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch basswood 8 inches
long and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch wide, with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole drilled
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch from each end. The floor of the auto, on
which the body rests, is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch basswood 6 &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches, and it binds the whole machine together, giving
it strength and rigidity, but it must not be fastened
in place until the structure is ready for assembling.</p>

<p>The hood is simply a box 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches long, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches wide, and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches high without a bottom.
The top piece may be left unfastened, if desired,
with two cleats on the under side to hold it in position.
The hood then becomes an available place
to keep small articles, tools, etc.</p>

<p>The body of the automobile is composed of five
pieces: the two sides of the shape shown at <i>b</i>,
the dash-board, to which they are fastened with
brads, the seat, and the back. This body can be
taken off and replaced by other bodies, made to
represent roadsters, touring cars, limousines, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">[65]</a></span>A block of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch basswood <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch square is
fastened to the dash-board. This block has a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole drilled through it at an angle of forty-five
degrees, and into this hole is glued the steering-gear,
consisting of a basswood stick, whittled to
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch diameter, with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch wheel 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches
in diameter fastened at the top, <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The method of assembling is important. First,
insert the front and rear axles through the holes
or bearings in the chassis, or frame; then nail the
floor to the frame with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brads. This gives a
rigid structure to work on, the front edge of the
floor being even with the forward ends of the frame.
Now screw into the under side of the floor, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches from the front end, a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch screw eye or
screw hook, or even a flat-head nail. This is
to hold one end of the rubber band which is to
supply the motive power.</p>

<p>The hood may now be put together and fastened
even with the front of the machine by nailing it
from the bottom with brads. The body is put
on by nailing the two sides to the dash-board, and
the dash-board to the hood. The seat and seat-back
are afterward put in place with brads and the
steering-gear glued in position against the dash-board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">[66]</a></span>The wheels should be put on last of all. Before
placing them in position, slip two or three new
rubber bands over the screw hook under the car,
and tie the free end to the driving pulley so tightly
that the cord will not slip on the pulley.</p>

<p>The front wheels are fastened to the axles by
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch flat-head wire nails, and worked until they
revolve freely on these pivots; the flat head holds
the wheel on.</p>

<p>The rear wheels are the drivers, and must be
fastened rigidly to the axle by glue. When the glue
has hardened&mdash;this takes several hours&mdash;the machine
may be sent across the room on the floor by
winding the rear axle backward as much as the rubber
bands will permit without breaking, and setting
the machine on the floor.</p>

<p>The first time the boys tried it, the rubber band
uncoiled so quickly that the auto shot across the
room and nearly wrecked itself against the wall.
This was too realistic, especially as it broke one of
the forward wheels, and a new one had to be made.</p>

<p>When such an automobile is to be presented to
little children who want to draw it around with a
string, it is necessary to remove the rubber band;
otherwise the rear wheels will drag.</p>

<p>When our boys had finished their machine, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">[67]</a></span>question came up to whom it should be given for
Christmas, and Harry blurted out, "I want it myself."
This was the greatest of all their difficulties.
When they had finished a piece of work they hated
to part with it, but Ralph was older, and he knew
that as Harry became interested in new things he
would gradually lose interest in the old ones. So
they played with this machine, made another with
a roadster body, and auto races became the rage
for awhile. After several afternoons of racing,
they decided, just as their elders had done before
them, that what their machines needed was improved
motive power. The accomplishment of this would
take them out of the realm of woodwork, so Ralph
suggested that they stick to their motto of "one
thing at a time." "And our business just now is
woodwork."</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br /><br />
<small>THE MODEL AEROPLANE</small></h2>


<p>The automobile experiment naturally suggested
the aeroplane, and after much
reading of magazines and animated discussions
as to the relative advantages of biplanes,
monoplanes, gliders, etc., the boys decided to try
their skill on a biplane of their own design, a
combination of the features and proportions of
the Curtiss and Wright machines.</p>

<p>The automobile was child's play compared with
the problems confronting the young aviators in
designing and working out a flying machine, and,
as in the former case, the question of motive power
was the most difficult. We might add it has not
yet been satisfactorily solved.</p>

<p><a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a> shows the general appearance of the
boys' model, which was eighteen inches long from
front to back, and the planes, made of light card-board,
were 14 inches long and 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches wide.
The frame, braces, rudder, and tilting plane were
made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch basswood, put together with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069">[69]</a></span><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch brads clinched wherever the points came
through.</p>

<p>The parts composing the frame were made first,
and all small details, such as rudder, propeller,
tilting plane, etc., cut out later.</p>

<p>The separate parts are shown in the drawing.
Four straight pieces like <i>a</i> were required to support
the tilting plane in front, and two pieces each
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> for the rudder in the rear. Two pieces
<i>a</i>, one of <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> were fastened together by
means of two uprights <i>d</i>, forming one complete
side of the machine. This was completed, and the
second side made identical with it.</p>

<p>These two sides were then fastened parallel with
each other, rigidly, by means of the two rudder
posts <i>e e</i> and the cross pieces <i>f f</i>, by brads. The
rudder posts bound the two sides rigidly at the
rear, the cross pieces at the centre, and at the forward
end the tilting plane was held in position by
the brads, which also acted as pivots.</p>

<p>This made a remarkably light and yet strong
framework. The card-board planes were not placed
in position until everything else was finished, as they
could be attached easily and quickly, but were very
much in the way when experiments were being made
on the propelling apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">[70]</a></span>Of course there had to be a propeller, and the
problem of making it required some practice.</p>

<p>Ralph introduced the subject by showing Harry
how to make an old-fashioned toy, shown in the
detail drawing, of two pieces, one the propeller,
the other a balancing stick.</p>

<p>The propeller was made of a piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
basswood, 4 inches long and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch wide. A
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole was first drilled at the exact centre.
The two ends were then whittled down to the shape
shown at <i>k</i>. The balancing stick was next whittled
down until one end fitted tightly into the
hole drilled in the propeller, and the rest of the stick
then rounded until it was of uniform diameter.
This stick was glued into the hole, and allowed to
dry.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work to do while the glue
was hardening, as the cross pieces <i>g g</i> had to be
fastened to the frame to prepare for the installation
of the power plant.</p>

<p>When the glue was dry, Ralph took the balancing
stick between the palms of his hands, drew his
right hand toward him with a quick motion, at the
same time releasing the stick. To Harry's amazement,
the whole thing flew up and struck the ceiling,
and for a few minutes aeroplanes were forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">[71]</a></span>
while the two played with this interesting but
ancient toy.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">[72]</a></span></p>


<p>Ralph explained that the propeller was simply
part of a screw thread, and had actually worked
its way through the air just as a screw works its
way into a piece of wood. Its lifting power had been
shown by the way it carried the balancing stick
with it up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued, "when we place a propeller
horizontal it will worm its way forward
through the air in the same way and carry the
aeroplane with it, for the simple reason that it is
so placed in the frame it can't get out. As the
free space it has to revolve in is only 3 inches, we
shall have to cut the blades down to about 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches to give it clearance."</p>

<p>They whittled out a shaft 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long and
fastened the two notched pieces <i>h h</i> to it after
placing the propeller in position between the two
cross pieces <i>g g</i> which had been previously drilled
with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch holes to act as bearings.</p>

<p>New rubber bands were then passed over the
notches, stretched out to the front and rear of the
frame, and tied to cross pieces.</p>

<p>By winding up the propeller, these bands were
twisted tightly, and when the propeller was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">[73]</a></span>released, the bands unwound, causing it to revolve
rapidly.</p>

<p>The rudder was now pivoted in position by
brads, and the two planes fastened by the same
method.</p>

<p>The power derived from the bands was not
sufficient to propel the aeroplane fast enough to
support it in the air, so it was necessary to experiment
with strong thread until the centre of gravity
was found. It proved to be near the centre of the
planes. Small holes were made with an awl at this
point, the thread passed through them and tied.
By suspending the aeroplane from a chandelier it
took up a horizontal position.</p>

<p>Then the forward tilting plane was elevated
slightly and the propeller wound up. On being
released the aeroplane slowly and majestically
sailed through the air in a great circle, limited by
the length of the suspending thread.</p>

<p>The boys never tired of this toy and all it
lacked was the ability to fly in the open air, which
would require a more powerful motor. This
would more than double the weight of the machine,
and therefore call for larger planes to support
it. There you have the great problem of the
aviator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">[74]</a></span>Ralph wisely suggested that as they had not yet
reached the stage of designing gasolene motors
they had better leave the aeroplane as it was, or
it would be necessary to abandon their woodwork,
which neither of them had any intention of doing.</p>

<small>THE MONOPLANE</small></h2>


<p>A very satisfactory monoplane can be made
from the plans shown in <a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>.</p>

<p>The material for the frame should be
quarter-inch white pine or spruce. The six long
strips are 30 inches in length, and for fastening,
holes should be drilled and the connection made
by passing fine soft wire through them and binding
fast.</p>

<p>The top frame, formed of four of these long
strips, should be made first, with particular attention
to the measurements, so that both sides shall
be exactly the same size and weight.</p>

<p>At the rear end the two long strips may be wired
together temporarily. The propeller shown in the
drawing can be made at any time from a piece of
white pine <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick and 12 inches long by
1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches wide. It is a good piece of whittling
work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076">[76]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 49 (a). The toy monoplane.</div>
</div>

<p>The <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch hole for the shaft should be bored
first, and the propeller blades reduced to a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">[78]</a></span>thickness
of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch at the centre of the blade, and
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch or less at the edges.</p>

<p>The shaft needs to be strong, and should be made
of a piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch dowel rod. Make a saw cut
with back saw in the end, which is to be fastened in
the propeller.</p>

<p>When ready to assemble, push this end into the
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch hole in the propeller, drive in a soft pine
wedge with a little glue, and a rigid fastening will
result.</p>

<p>The groove in the rear end of the shaft is to take
the thrust of the propeller, and hold it in the machine.
This groove may be readily cut out with
the knife, and smoothed with sand-paper. Two
bearings are necessary to hold the shaft in alignment.
The forward one is a strip of pine <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  by <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ,
with a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch hole bored at the centre. This
hole should be sand-papered until the shaft turns
in it freely. The rear bearing is a strip <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  by <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch,
laid out as shown at <i>a</i>. The quarter-inch hole
must be bored first. Next, drill two small holes
with a fine drill on either side of the hole for the
wires which are to hold the two pieces together.
Next saw on the pencil line shown, removing the
small piece <i>x</i>. Test the bearing by placing the
small grooved section of the shaft in the quarter-inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">[79]</a></span>hole to see if it turns freely. When this has been
accomplished, the propeller and its bearings are
ready for the monoplane.</p>

<p>Looking at the front view, the two uprights are
9 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches. At the top ends they are
rabbeted as shown, and wired to the top frame. At
the bottom they are wired to the long strips which
form the long sides of the bottom frame.</p>

<p>Before putting these uprights on, a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
hole should be drilled 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches from the bottom
of each. These are to receive the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch dowel
rod which acts as the axle for the spool <i>s</i>. This
rod should be 10 inches or more in length, so
that brads or wire may be passed through the
ends outside the uprights to keep the axle in
place.</p>

<p>The small spool which acts as a pulley must be
perfectly free to turn on this rod, and be kept in
place by two brads driven through drilled holes
on either side of it.</p>

<p>The front and lower parts of the frame are now
ready to be assembled.</p>

<p>The four long strips constituting the body of
the frame are all wired together at the back, temporarily.
To finish the forward part, saw out a
strip <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch, and form on each end a rounded
bearing, as in the automobile, for two wheels 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches in diameter. Saw the wheels out of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch
basswood, drill a hole at each centre, place on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">[80]</a></span>bearing, and fasten in place with a flat-head wire
nail and a small washer next to the wheel. Sand-paper
the wheels smooth, and see that they turn
freely. Tack the strip, or wire it to the uprights,
as low down as possible.</p>

<p>The rear end of the monoplane is a nice little
problem. Cut out a block of pine from 1 inch to
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches square. In the side facing the front
place a screw eye for fastening the spring or rubber
bands.</p>

<p>The rudder is shown in the drawing. Drill two
holes, as shown, and drive in brads or flat-head wire
nails, as large as the hole, so that the rudder may be
turned by hand, but not free enough to turn with
the wind.</p>

<p>Next drill a hole clear through the block for the
axle of the tilting planes.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the axle be at the exact
centre of the cube. It should extend quite through
both planes as well as the cube, and be bent around
the edges, so as to make them rigid. They should
be snug enough to turn by hand, but not loose
enough for the wind to shift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">[81]</a></span>The four sides of the frame are now whittled
down to fit the block, and wired to it.</p>

<p>Last comes the question of motive power.</p>

<p>This is <i>the</i> great problem. The writer is opposed
to encouraging boys to believe that these toy aeroplanes
can be made to fly great distances. The
propeller would have to be made to revolve at high
speed for several minutes in order to accomplish
this, and the tension of rubber bands is not equal
to it. The machines can be made to fly short
distances only. The problem of aviation is now a
question of motors, and the smallest gasolene motor,
with its tank, etc., requires a fairly large aeroplane
to lift it. No doubt, the problem will be solved
within a short time, but it has not been done at the
time of writing.</p>

<p>For this size of toy monoplane several large rubber
bands may be tied together, fastened at the
screw eye on one end and to a piece of strong linen
kite cord at the other.</p>

<p>Pass this cord forward under the spool and up
to the propeller shaft.</p>

<p>Drill a small hole in the shaft, draw the cord
taut, and fasten it through this hole.</p>

<p>While the model has no planes as yet, it is wise
to get the propeller working before putting them on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">[82]</a></span>as the space for working is freer. Wind up the
propeller until the bands have been stretched to
their limit, then let go. It may be necessary
to place wheels at the rear, the same as in front.
On a smooth floor, the machine should be drawn
forward several feet by the action of the propeller.</p>

<p>It is entirely practicable, on a plane of this size,
to use the works of an ordinary alarm clock in place
of rubber bands.</p>

<p>Remove the outer casing of an old clock; loosen
the four brass nuts that hold the frame together,
and take out all the wheels, except the axle on which
the mainspring is fastened. Put the frame together
again with the four nuts.</p>

<p>The axle for the mainspring extends outside of
the frame, and is threaded to receive the handle
for winding. Take this handle off. Drill a hole
in the end of the propeller shaft, slightly smaller
than the mainspring axle, and screw the latter into
the propeller shaft.</p>

<p>You now have the clock-works on the end of your
shaft, and it is necessary to fasten a strip of pine
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  in. by <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  in. to the upper sticks of the frame
in order to wire the works fast, as they must not
be allowed to turn. By turning the propeller you
wind up the clock, and as soon as you release it, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">[83]</a></span>there is no escapement now to regulate the spring,
it tries to unwind at once, and the propeller starts
at terrific speed. Look out for your hands, as the
propeller blades have no conscience.</p>

<p>This action, although strenuous, is short lived,
but much more powerful than rubber bands. The
spring of an ordinary alarm clock is powerful enough
to drive a wooden two-bladed propeller 12 inches
in diameter with blades two inches wide at the
outside. It will draw a monoplane of this size
along the floor several feet.</p>

<p>Having finally decided the question of power,
it remains to attach the planes.</p>

<p>The remaining long strip is wired to the top
pieces, 12 inches from the front, and the plane,
made of silk, oiled paper, or very thin card-board,
attached.</p>

<p>In many toy aeroplanes the bands of rubber
are not stretched, but twisted. The shaft in this
case is a wire which, after being fastened to the
propeller, passes through a glass bead and then the
frame, ending in a hook to which the rubber bands
are attached. There must be a perfectly clear
space from front to back of the frame. The glass
bead between the propeller and frame is to relieve
the friction.</p>

<small>KITES</small></h2>


<p>Making and experimenting with aeroplanes
calls for much patience and often ends
in disappointment&mdash;the lot of inventors
generally. This is no reason why work should stop,
as all progress is made by attempting the supposedly
impossible, but it will be restful after a while to
turn to the ancient and gentle art of kite making.</p>

<p>Incidentally, something may be learned about
the effect of wind on plane surfaces that will prove
helpful in aeroplane work.</p>

<p>The aeroplane kite shown in <a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a> is simple
and effective. It may be given the appearance of a
Bl&eacute;riot monoplane by modifying some of its features,
as shown at <i>b</i>, the planes having a slight upward
slant. The arrangement of the frames is clearly
shown in the drawing. Spruce or white pine may
be used, as lightness is an essential.</p>

<p>The method of fastening the sticks is important.
It is not wise to halve them, as their strength will
be reduced below the safety point, and nails are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">[85]</a></span>likely to split them. Bind them securely with
strong linen kite cord or fine soft wire.</p>

<p>Kite <i>a</i> is open to criticism on account of the
single stick connecting front and back. The second
form is better, and the two long sticks may be
correspondingly lighter without reducing the ultimate
strength of the frame. The method of joining
three sticks, as at the forward end, is shown in detail in
<a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>. Wherever a butt joint occurs, join the two
pieces by means of small strips of tin cut to size with
a pair of tinsmith snips. Drill holes through tin
and sticks, pass fine soft wire through the hole, and
twist tightly with a pair of pliers.</p>

<p>The planes or sails may be of light, strong paper,
or some light fabric, such as lawn or cheap silk.
The fabric should be cut to size, allowing two inches
each way for the hem. Pieces of cord are fastened
to the hem, and tied to the ends of the sticks through
small holes drilled for the purpose, or tied to notches
cut with the knife.</p>

<p>The advantage of this method is that the sails,
or planes, may be drawn tightly or removed without
loss of time. In this way a number of fabrics can
be used for experimental purposes. Paper, on the
other hand, must be lapped over sticks and wires,
and glued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">[86]</a></span>Propellers may be fastened to front, rear, or both,
to create the appearance of a real aeroplane.</p>

<p>The restraining action of the cord holding one of
these kites up against the wind brings into action
the same force that supports the glider or aeroplane,
and the sails, especially fabrics, assume the
curve of a boat sail, when close-hauled and sailing
into the wind.</p>

<p>The forms that are possible are infinite, and
limited only by the imagination of the designer.</p>

<p>It is well to begin with one of the standard types,
and leave experimental forms until some experience
has been gained.</p>

<p>The Americanized Malay, Eddy, or parakite is
shown in <a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>. The two sticks are of equal
length, bound together with twine or soft wire.
Distance <i>c e</i> should be from 14 to 18 per cent. of
the total length <i>c d</i>. The vertical stick remains
straight, but cross stick <i>a b</i> is bent back like a bow,
the distance <i>e f</i> being 10 per cent. of the total
length of either stick, and maintained by a string
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. The four points <i>a c b d</i> are joined
by a cord drawn taut, to make sure that the sticks
are at right angles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig50"></a><img src="images/fig50.jpg" width="600" height="442" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 50.</div>
</div>

<p>The material should be cut as shown, the amount
lapped being uniform all around. This is important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">[87]</a></span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">[88]</a></span>as a slight difference in weight between the two sides
would result in erratic flying. For Eddy kites up
to three feet in height a light-weight wrapping paper
will answer very well. Larger sizes require nainsook,
lawn, or China silk. Like all the kites described
here, this is a tailless one, and the method
of fastening the bridle is shown. Make a small
hole in the covering, pass a cord through, and
tie it to cross the stick at its centre. Fasten
the other end about half an inch from lower end
of upright, and make a loop at <i>o</i> for attaching
the line.</p>

<p>The kite line should be the light and strong linen
twine made especially for this purpose, and sold by
toy and sporting goods dealers. A ball containing
600 yards of cord, strong enough to hold any three-foot
kite, will cost about fifty cents.</p>

<p>For larger sizes, it pays to make a reel, to save
time drawing in and to avoid bad tangles. A
simple form of reel is shown in <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>.</p>

<p>The frame has a generous-sized hole bored as
shown at <i>h</i>. Cut a small branch in the form shown,
<i>i</i>, and use this as a stake. Drive it into the ground
through <i>h</i>, and use it as a pivot to shift the reel as
the wind changes. With this arrangement the
kite cannot drag the reel, and it is possible to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">[89]</a></span>the apparatus with the kite in the air. The writer
was driven to using this device after seeing his reel
go tearing across the fields until stopped by a four-foot
fence. The pull exerted at the reel by a train
of three or four kites is sometimes sufficient to give
a boy all he can do to hold it. The height to which
a kite will go is illustrated by the diagram. <i>S</i> is
the starting point, and <i>s t</i> the direction of the
string at the start, when but little cord has been
played out. The position of the kite at various
times is indicated by letters <i>a b c d e</i>, the actual
path being shown by dotted line. The solid, curved
lines from <i>s</i> to these points show the position of
the cord as it is played out. This is a mathematical
curve resulting from the weight of cord and kite,
wind pressure on cord, and lifting power of the
plane.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the kite finally moves along
horizontally, no matter how much cord is played out.
This occurs when the lifting power equals the force
of gravity and wind pressure. In other words,
the kite can do no more without an increase
of wind.</p>

<p>To make it go higher, we must raise point <i>s</i>
by tandem flying, attaching another kite and cord
to the first one, as shown at <i>x</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">[90]</a></span>Three or four Eddy kites may be flown in this way,
the lines of equal or unequal length joined at a
common point to the main line; and, strange as it
may seem, if they are well balanced kites they will
not interfere with each other. In fact, there seems
to be an electrical repulsion among the lines, so that
they spread out like a broom.</p>

<p>This is one of the most interesting discoveries
in kite flying, though badly upset in actual
practice, when one member of the team becomes
erratic and proceeds to make a braid of the
four cords by diving under and over the others
to bring about a general demoralization. For
this reason, it is wise to test each kite separately,
first, to discover any possible tendency to
freakishness.</p>

<p>A weird experience may be enjoyed by leaving
the tandem out after dark. Run the main line down
by slipping it under your arm, and walk out until
you reach the junction of the four lines, where a
light-weight lantern can be attached. Let go, and
see the lantern apparently drawn up into the air
by noiseless, invisible hands.</p>

<p>Flags and other devices may be attached as
indicated in the drawing; a light stick at <i>a b</i> will
keep the flag from blowing up into a heap, and loops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">[91]</a></span>at <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> are tied in the main line to avoid
sliding.</p>


<h3>THE BOX KITE</h3>

<p>The cellular kite is made in several forms. The
rectangular box variety is perhaps the most common,
and with the bridle attached is shown in <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>.
The standard dimensions are: length <i>a b</i> 79
inches, width <i>a c</i> 78 inches, depth of cell <i>c d</i>
32 inches, and width of cloth covering <i>c e</i> 25
inches. A very convenient size is obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">[92]</a></span>by dividing approximately by two, making
length and width 40 inches each, and depth 16
inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<a id="fig51"></a><img src="images/fig51.jpg" width="599" height="467" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 51. Kite details</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. H. H. Clayton, of the Blue Hill Observatory,
has patented one form of this kite known as
the "Blue Hill Naval Box Kite," so the amateur
must confine his use of it to experimenting. Other
forms of cells which have been used are shown
at 2 3 4 5. These all possess the advantage&mdash;that
each plane is a lifting surface, whereas in the
rectangular form the vertical planes have only a
rudder action, tending to hold the kite parallel with
the wind.</p>

<p>When launching a box kite, the assistant stands
in front of and under it, while with the Malay
he stands behind it and lets go at a given word.
About a hundred yards of line should be run out
before launching, and only a few steps backward
by the boy at the string should be necessary.
Running is only required when the line out is
insufficient.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 52. The tetrahedral kite</div>

</div>

<p>The tetrahedral form invented by Dr. Graham
Bell is unique and interesting. Based on the
geometrical figure, it has a remarkable strength
of frame, and possesses a surprising lifting power.
The principal difficulty in the construction is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">[93]</a></span>fastening the sticks, as three of them meet at every
point. The frame consists of six pieces of equal
length. Drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>-inch hole in each end of all the
pieces, about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch from the end. Place the
pieces on the floor as shown at 1. Pass a piece of
soft iron or brass wire through the three holes at
<i>a</i> and bind lightly. Do the same at angles
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. Now raise loose ends <i>d e f</i> until they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">[94]</a></span>tighten all the joints with a pair of pliers.
(<a href="#fig52">Fig. 52</a>.)</p>

<p>Each face of the frame is an equilateral triangle,
and the covering is to be on only two sides, as shown
at 3. The shape of the piece to be cut is shown
at 4. This forms a single cell, and the large sizes
are broken up into many small tetrahedral cells.
The line may be tied at <i>c</i> or <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The designing of fancy figure kites is a fascinating
occupation, but unless certain fixed principles
are kept in mind may end in much experimenting
and many disappointments. The question
of steadiness or stability seems to be summed
up in the mathematical expression&mdash;"dihedral
angle."</p>

<p>A kite having a stiff, flat surface presented to the
wind will often cut up queer antics, while the same
frame covered with a more flexible covering will
fly beautifully. The reason is that the flexible covering
will be bowed back by the wind, forming an
approximate "dihedral angle."</p>

<p>In the triangular box and tetrahedral kites
this bowing back is not so necessary, because
the dihedral angle is provided in the construction.</p>

<p>In these kites, when a sudden gust of wind presses
harder on one side than on the other, the first side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">[95]</a></span>is pressed back, reducing the resistance, and the
other side is brought forward until both sides receive
equal pressure, or the kite is in equilibrium,
facing the wind; and the shifting of the breeze is
constantly provided for. The bowing back of the
covering of an Eddy kite takes care of sudden
changes in the same way. Double Malay kites
or two tetrahedral kites, fastened together, tandem
fashion, will be found stable, especially if the
rear one be slightly smaller than the forward one.

<p>Geometrical forms like the hexagon, six-pointed
star, and even the circle are used, but these
generally require a tail.</p>

<p>A butterfly design may be used, provided the
body is designed as a keel and the two wings are
tilted backward to provide the required angle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">[96]</a></span>In some of the Chinese kites, in the form of insects,
the wings have split bamboo frames, flexible enough
to bend backward and provide the necessary stability.
A flexible lower end on the frame also has
a good balancing effect.</p>

<small>CHIP CARVING AND KNIFE WORK</small></h2>


<p>"Making moving toys is a form of dissipation,"
said Ralph. "It is very fascinating
and interesting, but the making of many
toys will never make one an expert woodworker.
The accuracy and skill required can be developed
only by actual constructive work. I suggest that
we take up a form of decoration which can be done
with the knife.</p>

<p>"There are two ways of making an article in wood
pleasing to the eye. One is by varying the outline,
as we did in our match scratchers, and the other
is by some kind of surface ornamentation. There
are many ways of decorating surfaces&mdash;carving,
pyrography, staining, polishing, etc., and very often
several of these methods are combined.</p>

<p>"As we have started to learn the possibilities of
knife work, I propose to teach you a form of carving
which can be done with the knife alone. Very
elaborate work is done with the regular carving
tools. This requires a great deal of time and skill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">[98]</a></span>but with the knife alone a wonderful variety of
beautiful work can be done even by small boys.</p>

<p>"It is very important to approach it properly,
so I am going to give you a few simple exercises
and the elaborate designs will come along naturally.</p>

<p>"The work is not new, and evidently grew out of
the still older art of notching. Primitive peoples
probably saw in it a way to improve the appearance
of their various wooden implements. Not only could
the edges be notched, but the cutting could be done
on flat surfaces as well."</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig54">Fig. 54</a> at <i>a</i> shows one of the earliest designs.
It is simply a border of triangular cuts, and while
this may be done with the whittling knife, <a href="#fig55">Fig. 55</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">[99]</a></span>shows two knives which are better fitted to do
accurate work.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 55. Two good types of knife for carving</div>

</div>

<p>The positions for carving are shown in <a href="#fig56">Fig. 56</a>.
Hold the knife in an upright position, with the cutting
edge away from you, and the point on the apex
of the triangle. Press the knife down and then away
from you along one of the sides of the triangle.
Place it in position again, and repeat the motion
along the other side of the triangle, always directly
on the line. This brings the deep part of the cut
at the apex of the triangle, and it remains to take
out the triangular chip. This can be done in either
of the two ways shown in <a href="#fig56">Fig. 56</a>, by cutting away
from you or toward you. It is well to practise
both ways, as in complicated designs the direction
of the grain makes it necessary to cut sometimes
in one direction, sometimes in another.</p>

<p>The rest of this border is a repetition of the same
stroke, and the more elaborate designs are simply
different arrangements of triangular cuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>In Fig 54, <i>b</i> shows two rows of these same shaped
cuts, one row inverted, to produce a diamond-shaped
border; <i>c</i> shows a border in which the drawing is
similar to <i>b</i>, but vertical triangles are cut instead
of horizontal ones, as this gives a cut across the
grain of the wood instead of parallel to it, and is
a trifle harder.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 56. Positions for holding carving knife</div>

</div>

<p>Our boys practised on these simple borders for
awhile, using knife <i>a</i> and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch basswood.
The work proved fully as fascinating to Harry as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>the making of toys, and it was decided that from
that time onward the outlines of their woodwork
should be simpler, and the decoration should be
in the form of chip carving.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig57"></a><img src="images/fig57.jpg" width="400" height="455" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 57. A simple picture frame with carving</div>

</div>

<p>While Harry was practising on these simple
borders Ralph made the basswood photograph
frame shown in <a href="#fig57">Fig. 57</a>, and drew the carving
design, as shown, with an H pencil.</p>

<p>To carve this was simply to repeat border <i>b</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>This was so satisfactory that Ralph decided to try
his pupil on finer work, and the design shown in
<a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a> was tried. In each case Harry found that
he was making triangular cuts, and removing triangular
chips, just as in the first border, only the
triangles were in different positions. Ralph suggested
that they begin to decorate some of the things
they had already made, and the little basswood
box shown in <a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a> was brought out, and the
design shown in <a href="#fig59">Fig. 59</a> drawn and carved upon it.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 58. A more elaborate picture frame</div>

</div>

<p>There followed a number of "backs," which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Ralph explained could be used as thermometer
backs, match scratchers, calendars, key racks, and
in other ways. In each case, the design was drawn
carefully on paper, and thence transferred to the
surface of the wood with the same care that it
had been done on paper. The designing required
considerable thought.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Figs. 59 and 60. Designs for box covers</div>
</div>

<p>Where a border continued around four sides, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>corner became the most difficult and interesting
part of the design, and was worked out first. (<a href="#fig61">Fig. 61</a>.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 61. Straight line designs for thermometer backs</div>

</div>

<p>Very soon the boys found that it was necessary
to draw only half the design on paper, and in many
cases a corner or quarter sufficed.</p>

<p>The next step was to initiate Harry into the
mysteries of curved cutting, a departure from
triangular cutting.</p>

<p>He was informed that the cuts were still three-sided,
one or two of the sides being but slightly curved.</p>

<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch gum wood, was Harry's first effort in curved
chip carving. The edges of the blank piece were
bevelled with a plane and Ralph showed his pupil
how to do this by holding the blank against a bench
hook. The long sides were bevelled first, the ends
last, to avoid breaking off the corners.</p>

<p>The key rack (<a href="#fig63">Fig. 63</a>) gave an opportunity to
use centre pieces inside a border, diamonds of the
flat surface being left uncarved for the placing of
the screw hooks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>A pencil box for school followed, the various
pieces being shown in <a href="#fig64">Fig. 64</a>. The two sides and
ends were made in one strip 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches wide, and
afterward cut to length. To secure this strip of
uniform width, the shooting board shown in Fig.
65 was used, the plane being laid on its side, giving
the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch piece of gum wood a perfectly square
edge.</p>

<p>Ralph was having his own troubles as a teacher
about this time, for he wanted to reserve Harry's
education in the use of bench tools until later on,
when he should have exhausted the possibilities of
the knife; but this method of using the plane was
necessary if Harry was to produce blank forms fit
for decoration.</p>

<p>The six pieces being squared up, a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch margin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>was left on all sides of the pieces to be carved&mdash;the
top, front, and two ends.</p>

<p>This <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch space was for the brads.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 65. Use of shooting board</div>

</div>

<p>The assembling was not done until the carving
had been finished, and it consisted of fastening the
long sides to the ends with <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch brads, with a
little glue on the end grain of the end pieces. The
bottom was put on with brads, and the top hinged
to the back by two small nickel-plated hinges.
A little hook and eye from the hardware store were
put at the front to hold the cover on, and two small
cleats were glued to the under side of the cover to
keep it from warping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>The time spent on this pencil box was several
hours, but the result was a box the like of which
could not be bought.</p>

<br />
<small>CHIP CARVING: <span class="smcap">Continued</span></small></h2>


<p>Among the many useful articles which can
be made with the knife in thin wood, with
carving as enrichment, are the numerous
desk accessories, such as envelope holders, letter
racks, stamp and pen boxes, pen trays, blotting
pads, etc. The boys, after exhausting the subject
of pencil boxes for school use, took up the design and
construction of letter racks. These, they decided,
should be in two compartments for answered and
unanswered letters. This called for three uprights,
or partitions, and a base. They decided to make
them of about uniform dimensions, as shown in the
blank form (<a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a>). The problem of the outline
was somewhat affected by the fact that the front
was to be carved. This called for a simpler outline
than would have been the case had they expected
to leave the surface plain. Some of the designs
they worked out are shown in <a href="#fig68">Fig. 68</a>.</p>

<p>The form marked <i>a</i> was selected as a beginning,
the three partitions cut out exactly alike, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>front piece carved as shown in Fig. 69. The
middle partition and back piece were left with
plain surfaces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig67"></a><img src="images/fig67.jpg" width="600" height="554" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 67. Parts of letter rack</div>

</div>

<p>The cutting of the grooves in the base was a new
problem, and Harry was allowed to try his skill
with a chisel. The method used was first to make
the drawing shown at <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a>. The long side
lines of each groove were scored with the point of
the knife, going over each line several times, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>make the cut as deep as possible. An under cut
was then made, as shown in the figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig68"></a><img src="images/fig68.jpg" width="600" height="601" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 68. Boys' designs for letter racks</div>
</div>

<p>The wood in the centre was removed with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
chisel, and the process continued until a uniform
depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch was reached. After all three grooves
had been cut, the edges of the base were bevelled with
the plane. This bevelling could have been done
readily with the knife, but much time was saved by
using the plane, always doing the long sides first.</p>

<p>In all the letter racks shown in the illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>the construction was the same. First, the three
blank partitions were made, then finished in their
outlines with knife and sand-paper. The carving
was always drawn carefully on the surface of the
front piece. Third, came the making of the base,
and last, the gluing of the partitions into the
grooves. To increase the strength of a letter rack,
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads can be driven from the bottom into
the partitions, but where this is done it is safer
to draw pencil lines on the bottom directly under
the centre of each partition. Place the point of
the brad exactly on the line before hammering.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 69. Form &quot;A&quot;</div>
</div>

<p>Although the forms of the letter rack are endless,
the one which our boys found most interesting was
based on the ellipse. It called forth a very instructive
drawing lesson. Ralph showed Harry first
how the figure could be drawn by a string, with
two pins to represent the foci of the ellipse. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>figure has two dimensions called the major
axis and minor axis. (<a href="#fig70">Fig. 70</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig70"></a><img src="images/fig70.jpg"  width="300" height="151" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 70.</div>
</div>

<p>The combined length
of the two lines drawn
from any point on the
ellipse to the two foci
must always be the
same and equal to the
length of the major axis. This is readily seen with
the two pins and string. (<a href="#fig71">Fig. 71</a>.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig71"></a><img src="images/fig71.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 71. Drawing the ellipse with string and pins</div>

</div>

<p>The pencil point as it traverses the ellipse represents
any point, and the string remains the same
length. Where it
is required to draw
an ellipse of definite
size, say two by
three, it becomes
necessary to find
the foci before the
string can be used,
and as it requires
considerable skill to get the string the exact
length, Ralph showed the boy another way,
called the trammel method. (<a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a>.)</p>

<p>Suppose the problem is to construct an ellipse
6 inches &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches. First draw the two lines <i>a b</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>and <i>c d</i> at right angles, intersecting at the exact
centre. Take a straight piece of paper, lay it
along <i>a b</i> with one end at <i>a</i>. Make a dot on the
edge of the paper where the lines cross, and mark it
<i>x</i>. Next, lay the same
strip of paper along
<i>c d</i>, with the original
end at <i>c</i>, and again
mark a point where
the lines cross. Mark
this point <i>y</i>. At any
position of this strip of paper when the points <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
touch the two axes <i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i>, the end of the paper
strip will be on the ellipse. By shifting this paper
trammel and keeping the two points on the axes a series
of points may be made at the end of the paper. Connecting
this by a pencil line will complete the ellipse.
This is a very simple method and a very accurate one.</p>

form for the letter rack, and gave an elliptical space

<p>Another feature of this rack was a change in the
middle partition; the form is shown at <a href="#fig75">Fig. 75</a>.
The making of the base and gluing into the grooves
were similar to the earlier designs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>The next design was characterized by an outline
composed largely of straight lines.</p>

<p>The middle partition was lower than the front

<p>The boys found a great deal of pleasure in working
out a decorative scheme for the carving. Having
discovered how easy it is to carve the long flowing
curves, they introduced them wherever possible.
The general shape of the carved section must of
course conform to the outline of the wood, but
while filling in these flowing curves they soon
learned to sketch them in free-hand.</p>

cut can be made at a time and that each chip is

<p>Harry was introduced at this time to the use of
the veining tool, a fine gouge with a cross section
almost V-shaped. This was used to emphasize
the outlines of the designs by simply pushing ahead
directly on the lines. When
veining straight lines, it may
be guided by a ruler or other
straight edge, but for curves,
a free-hand movement is
necessary. A very good
practice piece is the design
shown at <a href="#fig76">Fig. 76</a>. This may be applied to the
front of the letter rack design. (<a href="#fig69">Fig. 69</a>.)</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>were cut out with a knife to the blank forms shown.
On all pieces like these, afterward to be assembled,
the edges were made straight and square on the
shooting board, and the carving done before assembling.
This pen-holder was put together with
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads with the exception of the front, which
was glued, as it was thought best not to have nails
showing on this important side. (<a href="#fig78">Fig. 78</a>.)</p>

<small>CHIP CARVING AND KNIFE WORK (<span class="smcap">See</span> <a href="#IV">31</a>,
<a href="#XII">109</a>)</small></h2>


<p>"I like this new work better than anything we
have ever done," said Harry one day when he
and Ralph were up to their ears in carving,
whittling, and designing.</p>

<p>Ralph smiled as he remembered Harry's intense
interest in making moving toys. "As I told you
once before," he replied, "this is not new but old.
The people of northern Europe have done it for
centuries, and the reason is not hard to find. In
Norway during the long winter it gets dark very
early, in some places at three o'clock in the afternoon,
and does not become light again until nine
o'clock in the morning. The result is very, very
long evenings, when it is much more comfortable
to work indoors.</p>

<p>"At an early era the people developed this beautiful
art of carving, and spent their long evenings
in working at it. They became very skilful and as
most of the household utensils were of wood, it
was not at all unusual to see the household
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>furniture, even to their bread boards, beautifully
carved."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Harry, "can't I make a paper
knife now? You know you said I could after I
had learned to use the knife!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you might try your skill on something
of that character now. It will be quite a
change from this flat work we have been doing.
It will require a harder wood, however, than you
have been using, as a paper knife must be thin and
strong at the same time.</p>

<p>"The Swedish carvers use apple wood a great deal
for their paper knives, but as this is rare with us,
suppose we try rock maple. It is white in colour,
close grained, and hard."</p>

<p>As usual, they worked up their design on paper
first and sketched in the carving shown in <a href="#fig79">Fig. 79</a>.</p>

<p>A piece of rock or sugar maple was first squared
up and laid out in pencil as shown at <i>B</i>.
In order to get the outline to conform exactly to
the drawing, the form was cut out of paper and
traced on the face of the wood. The blank form
was then whittled out to the pencil line, and sand-papered
smooth as shown at <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Maple proved to be a hard wood to whittle.</p>

<p>Notches were cut at <i>d d</i> after drawing the edge
view on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>front and back edges. The blade and
handle were then whittled down to lines <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.</p>

<a id="fig79"></a><img src="images/fig79.jpg" width="600" height="432" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 79. Two designs for paper knives</div>

</div>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Harry, "don't ever give me
any maple to whittle again."</p>

<p>"Well, you wanted to make a paper knife,
didn't you? A paper knife that would break
when it fell on the floor wouldn't be of much use,
and you are not through yet. The blade must
be cut down to a fairly sharp edge on both
sides now."</p>

<p>This was done by bevelling the edges as shown in
<i>h</i> and the bevel gradually cut back to the centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>line, as shown at <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Harry concluded
that this was the hardest work that he had
ever done.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 80. Key rack designs</div>

</div>

<p>"Now you understand," said Ralph, "why I
couldn't allow you to make a knife at first. All the
training I have given you was necessary before you
had the requisite skill and control of your hands.
The carving will be easy for you because of all this
practice. Skill is something which comes that way.
Why, if I should give you the problem of making
that first key rack over again, you would do it in
about one third of the time, and very much better
than at your first attempt. You have been gaining
skill without knowing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>"Just to show you how much you have advanced,
I will give you one or two key rack designs to be
decorated with chip carving. When they are finished,
take them into the house and compare them with
the first you made. I think you will be amused
at the difference. That original piece of which
you were so proud will seem a very crude affair
now."</p>

<p>"All right," said Harry, "but I should like to
make one more paper knife first if you don't
mind."</p>

<p>"Very well; make up a new design, because no
artist ever duplicates his work," said Ralph with
a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>The smile was premature, however. The boy
had not been designing woodwork for nothing.
The design is shown at No. 2, <a href="#fig79">Fig. 79</a>, and even
Ralph, severe critic though he was, had to admit
that it was "pretty fair."</p>

<p>"Looks like a table knife," he said seriously.
"However, it is your own design, so go ahead and
make it. Try a piece of cherry this time. It
makes a good wood for carving, and is not quite
so hard to whittle as maple."</p>

<p>The different steps in the process of cutting this
out were the same as in No. 1, <a href="#fig79">Fig. 79</a>.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The key rack shown in <a href="#fig80">Fig. 80</a> was comparatively
easy after making paper knives. The bevelling
of the curves at the ends was the only new
feature of the knife work.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig82"></a><img src="images/fig82.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 82. Method of using the spokeshave</div>

</div>

<p>The making of presents went rapidly onward
from this time. The next article to engage our
woodworkers' attention was the blotting pad, made
of two pieces of black
walnut fastened together
with the screw
handle. (<a href="#fig81">Fig. 81</a>.)
The blotter is bent
around the curved
face of the lower
part, and the ends
gripped between the two parts by tightening
the screw. These handles with screw attached
are of brass, and can be obtained at any hardware
store.</p>

<p>The upper piece was bevelled, and a circular
space in the centre left plain to provide for the
handle, the rest of the space being carved.</p>

<p>The making of the curved face on the bottom was
too difficult for the knife, so the boy worked it out
with the plane and spokeshave shown in (<a href="#fig82">Fig. 82</a>).</p>

<p>When these blotter pads are finished with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>brass handle, coloured blotter and hand-carved top,
they are very attractive, and make acceptable
presents.</p>

<p>Toilet boxes were next in order, and there seemed
no end to them; glove boxes, collar boxes, handkerchief
boxes, boxes for storing away photographs,
etc. Those for collars were square, viewed from
the top, while glove boxes were made long and
narrow.</p>

<p>The construction of these called for the use of
carpenters' tools, and Ralph was not ready to start
his pupil on this branch of woodwork yet, for
several reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, it meant a halt in the fascinating
work of carving, and they had not yet
exhausted the possibilities of knife work. So they
tried the plan of buying ready-made boxes from the
stores. This was not entirely satisfactory, as most
of them were of basswood, soft, and easily carved,
but so white that it became soiled too readily.
This difficulty finally led to a unique scheme.
They stained the wood a dull ebony, and found that
the design showed very clearly in gray pencil lines,
easily carved.</p>

<p>The carving came out white on a black background,
and proved quite satisfactory for the coarser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>designs. The finer work, however, did not show
to advantage, and the method was adopted of leaving
certain portions of the surface plain.</p>

<p>One of the glove box designs is shown in <a href="#fig83">Fig. 83</a>.</p>

<p>The lines made in this black and white carving
by the veining tool are very effective.</p>

<p>The boys had just gotten nicely at work one
afternoon when Harry remarked very seriously:
"On what subject shall our lecture be this afternoon,
professor?"</p>

<p>A block of white pine hurtled across the shop,
but Harry ducked and no one was hurt.</p>

<p>"No," said Ralph, "you can't start a discussion
to-day. I've been thinking that you will have to
take up the use of bench tools pretty soon, because
you are really doing this work backward."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>"Why, you should never decorate anything which
you haven't actually made."</p>

<p>"Well, haven't I made everything we have carved
so far?"</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 84. Double photo frame</div>

</div>

<p>"All except the boxes. When we bought those
boxes, that was a signal that it was time for you
to begin constructive work. It has been a big
problem to give you carving to do on articles in the
flat that you could make with the knife. We will
make a few picture frames, carve them, and then
leave our carving until you can construct anything
in wood. You will always be able now to design
carved work for any given space; one of these picture
frames, however, is going to be a rather severe
test of your skill."</p>

<p><a href="#fig84">Fig. 84</a> shows the first photograph frame they took
up, a simple design in one piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>The openings for the pictures were cut out with
coping saw and knife and bevelled. The bevels on
the outer edges of the frame were planed.</p>

<a id="fig85"></a><img src="images/fig85.jpg" width="500" height="666" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 85. Carved picture frame</div>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a> shows a problem in designing for irregular
spaces, and the design is a typical Swedish
form. In both of these frames it was necessary
to provide a method of holding the photo on the
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>This was accomplished by tacking on two strips
of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch basswood on each side, and the bottom
as shown in <a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a>, the narrow strip being <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch
wide, and the top one <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch wide, making a
groove <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch deep to receive the picture. If it
is designed to have glass in front of the photo,
the narrow strip must be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch thick in place
of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch.</p>

<p>The problem of polishing carved work is rather
a difficult one. Ordinary varnish or shellac cannot
be used to advantage, as on flat surfaces, because
it fills up the spaces and ruins the effect. Perhaps
the best method is to dissolve a small quantity of
beeswax in turpentine, and
rub in with an old tooth
or nail brush, which is comparatively
soft. This will
not injure the carving, and
will protect it from dampness
and dust, as the wax hardens.
It should be put on when
about the consistency of
soft putty.</p>

<p>The photo frame shown
(<a href="#fig86">Fig. 86</a>) was the last form our boys attempted
in the flat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>It has the advantage of simplicity, only one kind of
cut being used; but the long flowing lines, which must
be first drawn on the wood free-hand, require all
the patience and skill one can command.</p>

<p>The form in outline is the artist's palette, and
the opening for the picture an ellipse.</p>

<p>All the lines in the carving converge to a point
to the left of the centre of the opening.</p>

<br />
<small>THE SHOP</small></h2>


<p>The man who is most successful is the one
who is best prepared for his work.
In beginning to learn how to use woodworking
tools, the average boy is very often
hampered by the lack of facilities. The place he
is to use for his shop should at least have good light.
Many of the lines he uses are knife lines, which are
harder to see than pencil lines, so that light at least
is an essential.</p>

<p>The tools should be as good as he can obtain.
This does not mean that it is necessary to have
elaborate sets of chisels, gouges, etc., but the cutting
tools should be of well tempered steel. It is far
better to have a few very good tools than an elaborate
equipment of poor ones, such as the boy's ready-made
tool chest often contains.</p>

<p>A good workman is one who can do a large variety
of good work with a few well-selected tools.</p>

<p>One reason for our having given so much space to
knife work was to illustrate this very fact. Very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>often the carved pieces described in previous chapters
are salable at good figures, and from the
money thus obtained a supply of bench or carpenters'
tools can be bought.</p>

<p>Next to a well lighted place in which to work,
a fairly good bench is essential. This can be made
by the boy himself, if he cannot secure one already
built, but as the construction of a bench presupposes
some previous practice with tools, we will assume
that our readers receive their first tool practice
on a bench already built, just as Harry did.</p>

<p>Several forms of benches on the market are
shown in <a href="#fig87">Fig. 87</a>.</p>

<p>The bench to be of any use must have a vise
of some description, as very often both hands are
required to guide the tool, and the wood must be
held rigid.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned screw vise is cheap, and a cheap
vise may be made at a cost of half a dollar, by
purchasing the screw and nut and making the jaw
and guides by hand, but this again calls for the
use of a bench. So taken all in all it will pay the
young woodworker to save his money and buy a
good vise even if the bench is home-made.</p>

<p>This is just where our boys had their first argument;
Harry wanted to begin by building a work bench.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 87. Types of work bench</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>"That is where you are wrong," said Ralph.
"Perhaps you remember that you wanted to begin
knife work by making a paper cutter, and as a
matter of fact it was very nearly the last thing I
gave you to do. It required all your skill and
previous practice to accomplish it. It will be just
the same with the bench and vise. You will be
able to construct them, but only after considerable
experience with tools. You might as well insist
on making all your tools before starting to use
them or you might insist on going into the woods,
cutting down trees and ripping out your own planks
for stock. Just wait a minute."</p>

<p>He went into the house and came out with a
pamphlet on lumbering, which he opened at the
picture shown in <a href="#fig88">Fig 88</a>. It represents the old
style of sawing out planks by hand before the
coming of the saw-mill.</p>

<p>The man in the pit is called a pit man, the one on
the log, the sawyer. This method of cutting
lumber was in vogue up to about fifty years ago.</p>

<p>"This," said Ralph, "is what your line of reasoning
would lead us back to, so if I am to be your
instructor you must leave these things to my
judgment, and my advice is to start work with a
good bench having on it a good vise."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>To let you into a family secret, the boys' work
in carving had been admired by several friends
and they had worked up quite a trade in making
and selling their carvings. From the money they
had saved they purchased the bench shown in
<a href="#fig89">Fig. 89</a>. It was very well built, having a heavy
top of 3-inch maple and a modern quick action
vise. The seven drawers underneath were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>really necessary, but the boys found them very handy
for storing tools, nails, screws, unfinished work, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="fig89"></a><img src="images/fig89.jpg" width="500" height="461" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 89. Bench with quick action vise</div>

</div>

<p>The space under a bench is very apt to become a
catch-all and a nuisance, so as time went on they
concluded that the extra cost of this bench was
justified, although at the time the price seemed
very high. Some of the cheaper benches they
looked at are shown in <a href="#fig87">Fig. 87</a>.</p>

<p>The quick action vise was a great time saver, as
it could be pulled wide open or pushed back without
turning the handle, as in the old screw vises.</p>

<p>A dozen of these quick action vises are on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>market, and may be had at hardware stores for
from four dollars upward.</p>

<p>This flat topped bench had no tool rack, and could
consequently be worked on from any side. At
first, the owners kept most of their tools in the large
drawer at the top, but later on they made a good
sized tool cabinet, which was fastened to the wall
and will be described later.</p>

<p>The iron bench stop also proved a valuable
feature, as it could be fastened at any desired
height by a set screw, or dropped down out of the
way below the level of the bench top. When
planing thin wood, one end of the board is braced
against the bench stop. Ralph found that starting
with a new bench had another advantage. It
helped his pupil to take good care of the bench.
Harry was very careful not to saw or cut it as he
might have done with an old bench, and to foster
this spirit of carefulness, Ralph gave him for his
first problem the making of a bench hook. (<a href="#fig90">Fig.
90</a>.) The tools used in its construction were:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>The maple board was first laid out as shown at
<i>a</i>, a pencil line being drawn 2 inches from one
edge. The piece was placed in the vise horizontally,
and both long edges planed straight and true and
tested with the try square.</p>

<p>The block was then placed upright in the vise,
and the ends planed square with the block plane.
This required much explaining and practise, as the
block plane has a bad habit of breaking off the
farther corner.</p>

<p>Ralph showed Harry how to use this tool safely
by planing only part way across the end and then
finishing from the other side. Both ends were
tested with the try square.</p>

<p>The piece was now sawed in two by using a rip
saw on the pencil line, the wood being held in the
vise in an upright position.</p>

<p>This made two pieces of stock 12 inches long,
one 2 inches wide, the other 8 inches nearly,
as the saw cut had removed some of the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>The 2-inch piece was laid out as shown at <i>b</i>.
The marking gauge was set at 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches and
from the joint edge&mdash;that already planed&mdash;a
line was gauged on each flat face, and the sawed
edge planed to these lines as at <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>It was then laid out as shown at <i>c</i>, two knife
lines being squared around the four sides <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch
apart. The piece was then sawed apart carefully
between these two knife lines, and the ends block
planed and tested.</p>

so they will be below the surface where they cannot

hook might always be handy and have a definite
place of its own, a half-inch hole was bored as
shown in the illustration, and it was hung on a nail,
set in the end of the bench.</p>

<p>The bench hook is designed to protect the bench
from saw marks and the cuts of chisels, gouges, etc.
The method of using it with the saw is shown in

of hard wood.</p>

<br />
<small>THE EQUIPMENT FOR A SHOP</small></h2>


<p>Nothing is so necessary to the saving of
time and energy as an orderly shop. Our
boys had bought a quantity of white pine
to begin operations and it was lying in a pile
on the floor where it was always in the way.</p>

<p>To cut a piece of stock from one of these 12-foot
boards it was necessary to use two kitchen chairs
for trestles, so it was decided to construct two saw
horses, and as soon as they were finished, to build
a lumber rack against the wall where their little
supply could be stored out of the way.</p>

<p>"We will carry out our regular practice by first
making a drawing," said Ralph. "We know from
experience that it saves time."</p>

<p><a href="#fig92">Fig. 92</a> shows the proportions of the trestle
at <i>a</i>, and the mechanical drawing with all dimensions
at <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The body of the trestle was built up of four pieces,
two long and two short ones. The open space in
the centre, Ralph explained, would make a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>venient
tool rack where hammers, chisels, etc., could
be placed while they were working, especially at
outdoor work, instead of being dropped on the
ground. The body then called for two pieces 3 feet
long by 4 inches wide, and two pieces 10 inches
long by 4 wide.</p>

<p>These were sawed from a rough plank with the
rip saw by using the chairs as trestles. A pencil
line was laid out 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches from one edge, and the
saw cut made directly on the line, 8 feet long.</p>

<p>The cross cut saw was used to cut the strip off
and this strip was then sawed with the same saw
into four pieces of equal length for the legs. Another
strip 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches wide, 7 feet 8 inches long, was ripped
out and taken off with the cross cut saw, for the body,
and divided into two pieces 3 feet 10 inches long,
for convenience in planing.</p>

<p>Harry now had his first real experience in planing.
All the pieces were of 1-inch rough lumber, with
sawed edges, and had to be planed down to <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch
in thickness.</p>

<p>To plane six pieces of stock straight and true, with
squared edges and of definite size, was no easy task.</p>

<p>"How do you like manual labour?" asked Ralph,
mischievously.</p>

<p>"I like it all right," replied the perspiring boy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>"but we won't need any gymnasium work for exercise
while we are doing this."</p>

</div>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to make a bench in hard
wood right away?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>"No, I guess you were right after all."</p>

<p>Ralph showed him the proper way to stand, and
how to hold the jack-plane so as to get the best
results. He promised to show him how to sharpen
and adjust the plane as soon as the lumber was
stored away on the lumber rack.</p>

<p>Harry's business was to dress down one of the
flat faces of each piece till it was smooth, straight
and true both with the grain and across it. He
tested it by his eye and the edge of his plane and
when he thought it was about right, passed it over
to Ralph for criticism.</p>

<p>Ralph was a very exacting instructor, but made
allowance for the boy's inexperience. He was
making the second trestle at the same time and it
was exasperating to Harry to see the ease with
which he turned out his work.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Ralph, "you can do as good
carving now as I, and in a few weeks you will be able
to do just as good joinery or carpentry. The first
day is always the hardest. You are all impatience
and want to get through right away. After a
while you will learn by experience that you can
only do one thing at a time, and will not rush so."</p>

<div class="caption">Using the Jack Plane.</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Finally, one face on each of the six pieces was
pronounced finished, and the next step was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>"joint" or "dress down" one edge straight, smooth
and square with the working face&mdash;the first planed
surface. This seemed easier after the experience
of making the bench hook, and Harry knew how
to test for squareness with the try square.</p>

<p>Working on the two long pieces for the body,
both edges of each were squared up, a 10-inch piece
was marked off on one end of each with pencil and try
square, and sawed off with cross cut saw.</p>

<p>It was decided to leave the inner faces rough,
as they would be inside the trestle, and out of sight.
These four pieces forming the body were now
nailed together with 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch wire nails, as shown
in <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The four pieces for the legs were dressed on all
four sides, and it only remained to cut the angle
at top and bottom.</p>

<p>This brought into use a new tool, the bevel.
The angle <i>x</i> was found by laying the bevel on the
mechanical drawing, and fixing it at the angle by
tightening the set screw provided for the purpose.
The line was carried across the face by means of
the try square, and the bevel used on the farther
edge. When this laying out was finished, the piece
looked like <i>c</i>, the triangular piece <i>y</i> being removed
by sawing directly on the pencil lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>After the four legs were laid out in this manner
and cut, they were nailed to the body with 3-inch
wire nails.</p>

<p>The saw horse was now complete with the exception
of the two braces, and the final truing up.</p>

<p>The braces were made by holding a piece of stock
4 inches &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch in position and marking the slope
with a pencil, sawing to pencil lines and nailing
in position <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The final process of truing up was an interesting
one to Harry, and he used it many times afterward
in finishing pieces of furniture, such as tables,
tabourettes, etc.</p>

<p>The horse was placed on the bench, and a pair
of dividers set as shown at <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>A line was scribed on each leg wherever the compasses
point touched it, holding the latter upright and
going around all four sides of each leg. By sawing
to the lines made in this way, the trestle was found
to stand on the floor perfectly true. This is a
method much used in truing up articles that rest
on three or more legs, and it overcomes any inaccuracies
that may have arisen in the process
of assembling; but it is very important that the
surface on which this truing up is done shall itself
be perfectly true. The bench used in this case was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>new and had not yet warped at all, but an old bench
might not have been suitable. This can be ascertained
by testing the surface in several directions
with a long straight edge.</p>

<p>The facts of warping and shrinkage in wood must
always be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The saw horse is an important part of every shop
equipment, and the boys now relegated the clumsy
chairs to the kitchen, where they belonged, and
were prepared to saw out stock from their longest
boards.</p>

<br />
<small>BUILDING A LUMBER RACK</small></h2>


<p>Ralph had painted two signs and fastened
them in prominent places on the wall. One
read: "One thing at a time"; the other,
"A place for everything, and everything in its place."</p>

<p>"Those are very old-fashioned," he said, "but
they are none the less absolutely true. Many boys
fail to accomplish anything in tool work because
they do not heed the first, and more time is wasted
than we ever realize, particularly among mechanics,
by failing to observe the second. It often seems a
waste of time to put a tool or piece of stock away in
a definite place, but, on the other hand, one often
spends ten times as many minutes in looking for
a thing as he would putting it in its place where it
could be found instantly."</p>

<p>"What's the answer?" said Harry absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"The answer is that we will make a rack for our
lumber before we do anything else.</p>

<p>"It need not be very fine work, but it will make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>our shop much neater, if the surfaces of the wood
are planed instead of being left rough, and to give
you practice in planing and to develop your muscles,
I am going to let you do most of the planing, while
I lay out the work."</p>

<p>The rack as finally constructed is shown in <a href="#fig93">Fig.
93</a>. The shop was not sheathed on the inside,
the framework or studding being exposed. The
short cross pieces were nailed to the studding
with ten-penny wire nails, but where they joined
the uprights they were let into the latter to
a depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch before being nailed. Harry
wanted to know what this was for, and Ralph explained
that if the cross pieces were simply nailed
to the uprights, all the weight would be carried by
the nails. By letting or "gaining" them part
way into the uprights, the weight was carried by
the latter without so much strain on the nails.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you let them into the wall
studs too?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Because the studs are in position and we couldn't
saw them out without breaking through the outside
of the building; therefore we are obliged simply
to nail them on."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig93"></a><img src="images/fig93.jpg" width="600" height="633" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 93. The lumber rack</div>

</div>

<p>Four of the uprights were spaced three feet apart,
and held in place at top and bottom by blocks nailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>to the ceiling and floor. A carpenter would have
simply "toe-nailed" them by driving nails at an angle
through the ends of the uprights into the floor, but the
boys were not yet skilled in carpenters' methods.
An ideal lumber rack is made of galvanized iron
pipe. It is indestructible, fire-proof, rather ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>pensive,
and the joints are regular pipe fitter's
joints, elbows, tees, crosses, and floor plates.</p>

<p>This was beyond our boys' pocket-book, as it
would have required the services of a pipe fitter.</p>

<p>One of the uprights laid out and partly cut is
shown at <i>a</i>, the openings having been taken out
with cross cut saw and chisel.</p>

<p>On one of the upper tiers the cross pieces were
made eight inches longer than the others, and where
they extended beyond the front of the rack pieces
of pine 6 &times; 2 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches were nailed to the ends,
making a convenient hook for hanging hand screws,
which are always in the way on the floor. It also
made a very convenient shelf for storing narrow
waste strips of lumber, which should not be destroyed,
as one can never tell when they will be
needed.</p>

<p>In the case of a rack made of iron pipe, the ends
of these long cross pieces need be only ordinary
pipe elbows.</p>

<p>The labour of building a lumber rack was much
heavier than anything the boys had done before,
but it brought the larger muscles into play, seemed
like real carpenter work, and was an excellent
preparation for the finer tool work to follow. A boy
who has never carried out a piece of large work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>successfully cannot realize the satisfaction of looking
at a really good piece of construction and being
able to say, "I made that all myself!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig94"></a><img src="images/fig94.jpg" width="600" height="402" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 94. First wind vane</div>

</div>

<p>Ralph suggested that one or two things more
were needed to make their equipment ship-shape&mdash;one
was a tool cabinet, and another was some arrangement
for storing small pieces of stock; but
as both of these required considerable tool practice,
they were recorded in a notebook as among the
things to be done later on.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the shop needed a vane to
show the direction of the wind, and the boys' design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>for this is shown at Fig. 94. It included a weather
vane and windmill.</p>

<p>The whole combination required five pieces of
wood. The two short pieces, 7 inches long
by 1 inch square, were first dressed to size, cut
out and halved together as shown. They were
then taken apart and cut to the lines shown, with
a knife, making propeller blades similar to those
made for the aeroplane. When both were finished,
they were again put together, and a hole drilled
through the centre a trifle larger than a flat-head
wire nail 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long. This nail is to hold the
mill to the horizontal piece. The nail is to be tight
in this horizontal piece, but the windmill must
revolve freely about the nail. It is for this reason
that the hole in the mill must be slightly larger
than the diameter of the nail.</p>

<p>The horizontal piece is bevelled on one end with
the knife and has a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch slot sawed out at the
other. The slot is to receive the wind vane. The
vane was sawed out of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch wood, fitted into
the slot and nailed with brads.</p>

<p>When all these parts were assembled, it was
necessary to find the centre of gravity of the whole
combination, as it is important that it be perfectly
balanced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>To find the correct point, a light string was slipped
under the horizontal piece and moved back and
forth until the vane hung horizontally. The spot
where the string touched the wood was marked with
a pencil and a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole drilled at this point
for the pivot. A corresponding hole was drilled
3 inches deep into the bevelled end of the standard.</p>

<p>A piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch maple dowel was used as a
pivot, the upper end being sand-papered until the
vane swung freely. The boys found that by placing
a metal washer between the vane and its standard,
much of the friction was removed. A wire nail
driven into the standard through a hole drilled
in the horizontal piece would have answered the
same purpose as the dowel. When the centre of
gravity is not found for the pivot, the vane is apt
to tilt forward or backward and not only look
badly, but bring considerable friction on one end,
so that it will not revolve freely with the wind.</p>

<br />
<small>MILLS AND WEATHER VANES</small></h2>


<p>The subject of windmills and weather vanes
opened up a field that seemed inexhaustible,
and for a while there was a perfect furore
of designing and experimenting. As usual, Harry
wanted to try great schemes that Ralph knew were
impracticable, and it required all his diplomacy
to keep the boy down to earth, on something simple
and within his power to do successfully.</p>

<p>One of his earliest attempts was a scheme to
make a windmill on the principle of a water-wheel,
placed horizontally to catch the wind.</p>

<p>Ralph knew that it would not work, but after
arguing for some time, he decided to let the youngster
learn by experience. While Harry was working
at his project, Ralph sketched out and made a vane
which he considered an improvement on the first one.
It is shown in <a href="#fig95">Fig. 95</a>; and it was made without a
mill and composed of four pieces. The horizontal
piece had an arrow head at the forward end. At
the rear end, two pieces of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch pine were fastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>with two small bolts. From the point where they
were bolted they curved outward as shown in the
top view, and were held in that position by two
small strips nailed on with brads, one on the upper
and one on the lower side. The centre of gravity was
found as before, and the vane pivoted to its standard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig95"></a><img src="images/fig95.jpg" width="600" height="207" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 95. Second wind vane</div>

</div>

<p>In the meantime, Harry had found out to his
own satisfaction that his water-wheel windmill
would not work.</p>

<p>"What have you curved those ends out for?"
he exclaimed on catching a sight of Ralph's vane.</p>

<p>"Why, to make it more sensitive to the slightest
breeze. Those curves catch the wind quicker than
flat surfaces; have you never noticed that on the
weather bureau vanes they are always curved out
like that?"</p>

<p>"No," said Harry. "By the way, do you know
why my mill doesn't work?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>"I have told you about six times that a
water-wheel receives the water on one side only,
while your mill receives the same pressure on both
sides of the centre. The two forces balance, so
your mill can't very well turn. If you could cut
off the wind from one side, it would go all right."</p>

<p>"Well, why can't I box in one side?"</p>

<p>"You can, but then you will have to shift it
every time the wind changes. You could construct
a combination mill and vane, and arrange it so that
the box would be shifted by the vane, but honestly,
I don't think it worth the trouble. It would be
clumsy, top-heavy, and hard to balance. I have a
scheme for a horizontal mill, but we will take it
up later. In the meantime, let's make a happy
jack windmill!"</p>

<p>"Happy jack?"</p>

<p>"That's what they call them, but we will try
to be original and I propose an Indian with war
clubs."</p>

<p>"Whew! That sounds interesting!"</p>

<p>Ralph's sketch of the Indian is shown in <a href="#fig96">Fig. 96</a>.
The figure was sawed out of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch pine, a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
hole bored for the arms, and a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole bored for
the dowel pivot at the feet. The arms were made of
a piece of dowel, six inches long, with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch holes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>bored near the ends to receive the "clubs." These
were whittled out of pine, each club being a propeller
blade. When fastened into the dowel they
formed a complete two-bladed propeller, but this
was not done until the dowel had been inserted
through the Indian's shoulders,
and a brad driven through on
each side of the body to keep
the arms in place.</p>

<a id="fig96"></a><img src="images/fig96.jpg" width="300" height="493" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 96. Happy jack</div>

</div>

<p>Harry was so anxious to see it
work that he came near spoiling
it, and had to be restrained by
the older boy, as in making these
toys a well balanced figure is
very important. When it was
finally finished, and placed out
in the wind, the antics of the Indian made Harry
laugh till the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"That's the finest thing we ever made," he said.
Ralph smiled. It seemed that he had heard something
like that several times before.</p>

<p>An athlete was suggested, and a bold figure with
outstretched arms was sketched, as shown in
<a href="#fig97">Fig. 97</a>.</p>

<p>The Indian clubs he is supposed to be swinging
were propeller blades, and to give them more
uniform motion than in the case of the Indian, the
hands were drilled and a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch dowel
inserted. At each end of
the dowel was fastened a
blade which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>drilled to fit. Brads were
driven through the dowel
on each side of the hand
to keep the clubs swinging
freely.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 97. An athletic happy jack</div>

</div>

<p>The body and arms
were cut from a piece of
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch pine and halved
together across the chest,
and after the joint was
made the form of the
body and the arms whittled
out with a knife.
The two parts were then
fastened together with
brads.</p>

<p>It was important that
this figure face the wind,
so into the space between
the ankles was fitted the small end of a wind vane
and the figure securely fastened to it with brads.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>The centre of gravity was then found and the whole
combination pivoted on a generous piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
dowel.</p>

</div>

<p>This athletic weather vane is painted in bright
colours, the clubs being gilded to make them realistic
Indian clubs.</p>

<p>"What was that scheme of yours for a horizontal
windmill?" asked Harry after he had watched the
athletic club swinger until he was satisfied.</p>

<p>"Why, to make one on the principle of the
anemometer," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"How do you spell it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>"Never mind the spelling, it's like this," and
Ralph rapidly sketched out <a href="#fig98">Fig. 98</a>.</p>

<p>"This is the wind gauge of the weather bureau,"
he explained, "and I figure we can use ordinary tin
cups for the buckets. You go down to the hardware
store and buy four small round bottomed tin cups
while I start the woodwork."</p>

<p>Having secured the cups for five cents each, they
cut the handles with a pair of tinners' "snips."
The cut was made next to the cup at the lowest
point and the handle straightened out even with the
top of the cup.</p>

<p>Two pieces of pine, 16 inches long, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch wide,
and <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch thick, were halved together at the centre,
where a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole was bored straight through the
joint.</p>

<p>A block of wood cut to the shape <i>a</i> was fitted
over the joint, and fastened to the four arms with
1-inch brads. The <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole was now continued
almost through this cap to give a long bearing for
the pivot&mdash;a ten-penny wire nail with the head
filed off. Two <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch holes were drilled through
the handle of each cup and corresponding holes
through the wooden arms. The cups were made
fast by passing <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch bolts through cup handles
and arms and tightening the nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>This made a very strong and rigid construction
and on testing it by holding the pivot in the hand
out in the breeze the instrument revolved rapidly.</p>

<p>Altogether it was one of the most substantial
and satisfactory things that they had made, but
Ralph was not yet satisfied.</p>

<p>"We might as well have a Coney Island of our
own as not," he said. "You whittle out four
propellers, 4 inches long and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch across, and I'll
show you something," he said.</p>

<p>While Harry was doing this, Ralph sawed out
four wooden dirigibles shown at <i>b</i>, 8 inches long,
3 inches across at the widest part, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch thick.</p>

<p>A hole was drilled through the centre of each
propeller and another in the flat stern of each air-ship.
The pivots for the propellers were flat-head
wire nails small enough for the blades to revolve
freely, but driven securely into the air-ships.</p>

<p>These were now fastened at the ends of the arms
of the anemometer by attaching two strips of basswood
to each ship by wires. The strips were to
hold the ships in the proper position facing in the
direction of motion, which was always the same,
no matter in which direction the wind was
blowing.</p>

<p>The upper ends of these strips were brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>together, and securely fastened under one of the
bolts by wires.</p>

<p>As the anemometer revolved, centrifugal force
sent the air-ships out as far as the basswood strips
would allow.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting fair weather toy, but
the first gale, while having no effect on the anemometer
other than to make it spin around at
terrific speed, nearly wrecked the ships by slamming
them against the standard. So the boys always
took the ships off at night,
and put them on again when
they wanted to give an
exhibition.</p>

<p>The propellers were
gilded and the ships painted in bright colours.</p>

<p>A very simple vane may be made to represent
a Zeppelin air-ship (<a href="#fig99">Fig. 99</a>) by cutting out a piece
of white pine 2 feet long and 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches wide with
the ends pointed to the shape of a Gothic arch.
The hole for the pivot should be bored 2 inches
deep and be placed well forward of the centre.
To make the vane balance, the rear portion from the
pivot to the stern should be planed thin and rounded
with the spokeshave.</p>

<p>At the stern should be a small two-bladed pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>peller,
pivoted on a flat-head wire nail. If the stern
is still too heavy, the balance can be restored by
driving into the forward point a round-headed screw,
or by attaching another small propeller. In fact, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>the hole in this propeller is made large enough, the
screw can be used as the pivot; in any event, the
vane must be balanced by adding some kind of weight
at the bow.</p>

<p>These typical forms of wind vanes will suggest
others and the young woodworker should try to be
original, to design new forms, ships, submarines, air-ships,
etc.</p>

<p>One form which the boys made was especially
substantial and reliable. A six-bladed mill was
constructed as follows:</p>

<p>First: a piece of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch pine was cut to the form
of a hexagon 2 inches across the points.</p>

<p>Second: a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole was bored in the centre
of each of the six edges and a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole through
the centre of the hexagon. (<a href="#fig100">Fig. 100</a>.)</p>

<p>Third: six blades were formed from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch pine
8 inches long, 2 inches wide, tapering down to 1
inch at one end.</p>

<p>Fourth: in the small end a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole was bored
at the centre, about an inch deep.</p>

<p>Fifth: the blades were tapered in thickness from
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch at the small end to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch at the wide end,
the tapering being done on one side only, that away
from the wind, the side facing the wind being perfectly
flat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>Sixth: dowel pins were glued securely into the
holes in the hexagonal block and into the blades, the
latter being turned on the dowels at an angle of
about 30 degrees&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  a right angle&mdash;from the
front face.</p>

<p>Seventh: after the glue had hardened over night,
the whole mill was painted, special attention being
given to covering the joint where the glue held,
to prevent the rain from loosening it.</p>

<p>Eighth: two pieces of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch white wood
were cut out to the form shown at <i>b</i>. These were
fastened to the square piece <i>c</i> by two small bolts.</p>

<p>The wide ends of the vanes were spread and
fastened by two small strips of white wood, by
brads as shown.</p>

<p>Ninth: last came the locating of the centre of
gravity, after the mill had been attached by a ten-penny
flat-head wire nail. The pivot was made of
a similar nail into the standard, as on previous
wind vanes.</p>

<br />
<small>TOOLS: SAWS</small></h2>


<p>The boys now took up the systematic study
of tools, as Ralph suggested that they had
spent time enough on toys and curiosities.</p>

<p>A cutting tool must be constructed with reference
to the material it is to cut. In the machine shop,
we find the angle of the cutting edge large&mdash;often
80 degrees&mdash;while a razor has a cutting edge of
about 5 degrees. All cutting tools are wedges,
whether saws, chisels, planes, axes, or knives, and
the angle depends on the hardness of the material
in which it is to work. The action of the tool may
be a chisel action, a knife action, or both. In the
rip saw, the teeth are really a series of chisel edges
cut in one piece of steel, while in a cross cut saw we
have a knife action for cutting the fibres, followed
by a chisel action for removing the wood.</p>

<p>The side view of a rip saw is shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig101">Fig.
101</a>), the end view at <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The chisel-like edges are bent outward to right
and left alternately. This is called the "set" of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>teeth and its purpose is to make the cut wider than
the body of the saw, to prevent friction. As the
saw teeth pass through the wood, the fibres spring
back against the saw blade or
body, and the friction makes
the work almost impossible
without "set" to the teeth.
All woodworking saws must be set, and special
tools called "saw sets" are sold for the purpose
of bending out the teeth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 101. Teeth of rip saw</div>

</div>

<p>The rip or slitting saw should only be used for
cutting with the grain. When used across the grain,
the action is exactly like that of a narrow chisel,
and it will tear the fibres instead of cutting them.</p>

<p>The teeth of a cross cut saw are shown in <a href="#fig102">Fig. 102</a>.
At <i>a</i> is the side view, and at <i>b</i> the end view.
The teeth are set and filed to a knife edge. This
gives two parallel lines of knife-like teeth which
cut the fibres in two
parallel lines, while the
body of the tooth
cuts out the wood in
the form of sawdust.
All woodworking saws belong to one of these
two classes, and the cutting angles of the teeth
are shown in <a href="#fig103">Fig. 103</a>.</p>

We are very apt to regard the saw not only as
a very commonplace article, but as a fixed quantity
which has always been the same and always will
be. As a matter of fact, the saw
has gone through a process of
evolution the same as the electric
motor, automobile, and aeroplane.
New methods of its manufacture
are constantly being invented and
improvements made in its construction.
Some of the steps in the
process of making a hand saw
are: rolling the steel plate of which
the body is made, hardening,
tempering, hammering or
smithing, grinding, polishing,
filing, setting, etching,
handling, and blocking.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig104"></a><img src="images/fig104.jpg" width="300" height="408" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 104. Two methods of handling</div>

</div>

<p>The handling refers to
the placing of the wooden
handle and some idea of
what it means is illustrated
in <a href="#fig104">Fig. 104</a>, showing two
methods of attaching the
apple wood handle.</p>

<p>Some idea of what the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>grinding means is shown by the tapers, or difference in
the thickness of the steel, as shown at <a href="#fig105">Fig. 105</a>, the
thickness in one thousandths of an inch being given at
the different points. It will be noticed that not only
does the blade decrease in width from the handle out
to the end of the saw, but the thickness decreases from
the teeth to the top and also from the handle out
to the end. This represents ideal saw construction,
and it is found only in the good makes.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 106. The back saw</div>

</div>

<p>The back saw, being strengthened by a heavy
piece of steel along the top, is made of thinner
material, and the tapers are not necessary, for the
back piece gives rigidity. It removes less wood,
but is limited in its action
by the back. It is used
chiefly by pattern makers,
and for finer bench work,
such as cabinet making, but should be part of
every boy's outfit.</p>

<p>The compass-saw shown at <a href="#fig107">Fig. 107</a> is used for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>general purposes, but is not so necessary as the back
saw. It is useful for cutting out small openings,
though it is not as valuable for this purpose as the
turning saw.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 107. The compass saw</div>

</div>

<p>One end of the turning saw can be released from
the frame by removing a pin, passed through a small
hole. This is fastened in the frame again and made
to follow a curved line like a fret or coping saw.</p>

</div>

<p>The number of teeth to the inch varies, and saws
are rated as four-point, five-point, etc., according to
the number of points or spaces to the inch. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>very hard woods, a saw with small teeth, <i>i. e.</i>, with
more points than ordinary to the inch, should be
used; but a boy who possesses one saw of each kind&mdash;a
rip, a cross cut, a back saw, and a turning saw&mdash;has
all that will be required for ordinary woodwork.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 109. Using the rip saw and trestles</div>

</div>

<p>In working with the board on trestles, the saw
should be held at an angle of about 45 degrees to
the surface. When sawing a board held in the bench
vise, this is not so easily done, but the cut should
at least be started with the tool in the correct
position. (<a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>The hack saw is used for cutting metal, and while
not essential for woodwork, is often valuable for
cutting pieces of pipe, rivets, bolts, screws, and nails
and should be added to the outfit when the finances
will allow. (<a href="#fig110">Fig. 110</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>In fact, there is no such thing as a set of tools.
Good tools only should be bought, and the outfit
at first should be simple; new ones can be added
from time to time, as they are needed. In this way
one learns the possibilities of his kit much better
than by starting with an elaborate collection.</p>

<br />
<small>TOOLS: PLANES</small></h2>


<p>A boy buying his tool outfit is often bewildered
by the array in the hardware store. He is
further confused by the advice of the salesman,
and his own little store of money.</p>

<p>In selecting planes, only three are really necessary
for ordinary work, and this number may even be
reduced to two.</p>

<p>Wooden planes are still the favourite tools of some
woodworkers, but iron planes have largely superseded
them. A 15-inch iron jack plane, a 9-inch
smoothing plane, and a block plane make a very
good combination for a beginning.</p>

<p>Special planes can be added later, as the finances
will allow.</p>

<p>The iron plane with its various parts is shown in
<a href="#fig111">Fig. 111</a>. These refer to either the jack or the
smooth plane.</p>

<p>In the block plane there is no cap iron, the cutter
or plane iron being placed with the bevelled side
up. There is frequently found on this tool an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>adjustment for changing the amount of opening in
the mouth for hard or soft woods.</p>

<p>The plane iron and cap are fastened together with
a set screw, and the cap is removed when it is being
ground or sharpened on an oilstone.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig111"></a><img src="images/fig111.jpg" width="400" height="309" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 111. The smoothing plane</div>

</div>

<p>This set screw,
which is loosened
with a screw-driver,
or the edge of the
clamp used as a
screw-driver, also
allows the distance
from the cutting
edge to the cap
to be changed
for soft or hard
woods. These
two irons are
fastened into the
throat of the
plane by the
clamp.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig111b"></a><img src="images/fig111b.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 111b. The smoothing plane</div>
</div>


<p>The lever (1) is for straightening the plane iron,
and the screw <i>s</i> is for adjusting the depth of the cut.</p>

<p>The difference between the jack and smooth
planes, aside from the size, is in the shape of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>"cutter" or "bit." In the jack plane, the bit is
ground with a slightly curved cutting edge. This
enables the tool to remove coarse shavings, but
leaves a slightly corrugated surface which must be
smoothed with the smoothing plane.</p>

<p>The jack plane also tends to straighten the work,
owing to its greater length. The greater the
length, the more does it straighten. The old-fashioned
jointers were made several feet long for
this very purpose.</p>

<p>If a boy can afford only one plane, it should be
a jack plane, but the cutter should be ground straight
to act as a smooth plane.</p>

<p>The block plane can be dispensed with better
than any of the others, because the smooth plane
can be used on a shooting board for truing up end
grain, the original purpose of the block plane.</p>

<p>The latter plane has no cap, as it works on the
ends of the wood fibres with a shearing or paring
action. This is helped by holding the tool at an
angle with the wood, a position not advisable with
the other two tools.</p>

</div>
<hr class="chap" />

<p>The proper position for planing is with the
right side to the bench, the plane held flat on
the work. Each stroke should, wherever possible,
be the full length of the board, unless one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>part is higher than the rest of the surface. This
may be ascertained by using the edge of the
plane as a straight edge. High spots should be
marked with a pencil, and then planed off, till the
full length strokes can be made, and the edge planed
straight and true. In surface planing, if the surface
be warped, the amount of wind may be determined
by placing two "winding" sticks&mdash;two straight
pieces of the same size at the two ends&mdash;and sighting
with the eye along their top edges. To take out
wind, it may be necessary to plane diagonally across
the grain from corner to corner. This defect is
common in lumber not properly piled or seasoned,
and is more noticeable in such woods as gum or
chestnut.</p>

<p>The sharpening of plane irons is a very important
part of one's knowledge of tool work, and of course
applies to chisels, gouges, and all cutting tools.</p>

<p>Remember that the cutting edge or bevel is a
wedge, the angle of a plane-iron bevel being from
25 to 35 degrees, the smaller angle for soft wood,
the larger for hard. This angle is not measured
by the woodworker often, but is a matter of
experience. If the young mechanic will keep his
tools ground to the same angle as he finds them at
the time of purchase, he will not go far astray.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>This angle should be a clean-cut one, however.
<a href="#fig112">Fig. 112</a> shows some correct and some incorrect
ways of grinding. At <i>a</i> is shown the right way,
<i>b</i> is not an angle at
all, and <i>c</i> is a waste of
time and material. At
<i>d</i> is shown the worst
fault of all&mdash;a "back
bevel." This occurs
when the tool is carelessly
turned over and
ground on both sides, which renders it useless until
all the steel in front of the dotted line has been
removed; in other words, until the tool is reground.</p>

<p>This mistake is sometimes made in using the oilstone,
by rubbing the tool on both sides instead of
on one only. All the grinding and sharpening must
be done on the bevelled side. As the plane iron
is only a thin chisel, the sharpening of the latter
tool is performed as in the case of the plane iron,
and the same care should be taken to keep the
bevel clean cut.</p>

<p>A good grindstone is a shop necessity, and, one
might add, a household necessity, because every
household uses knives, and the dull knife is an
altogether too common nuisance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>Our boys hung up another sign at this stage, and
it read, "Keep your tools sharp." This ought to
go without saying, but it is a fact that many people
make failures of their work and become disgusted
with it because they do not keep their tools
in order. The satisfaction of using fine, sharp tools
cannot be explained; it must be experienced.</p>

<p>Like other things about the shop, there are many
kinds of grindstones on the market. The old-fashioned
stone with a wooden frame (<a href="#fig113">Fig. 113</a>)
worked by hand or a treadle may be good&mdash;it
depends on the stone&mdash;and the new one with a small
stone, iron, or pressed steel frame is handy. The
last stone is provided with a bicycle seat, and is
worked by both feet, so that the hands are free to
hold the tool. This stone has ball bearings, is
noiseless, and occupies less space than the other.</p>

<p>A stone that is soft and gritty, rather than one
that is hard like a piece of granite, should be selected.</p>

<p>In holding the tool against the stone, some
common sense is necessary. The harder one presses,
the quicker the grinding, but if there is not plenty
of water on the stone, the tool may be "burned."
When a black place appears, you have destroyed
the temper, showing that there has been too much
pressure, or too little water, or both.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>The tool may be moved back and forth across
the stone to keep its face true, but never up and
down. This up and down motion is careless and
gives the defective edge shown at <i>b</i> (<a href="#fig112">Fig. 112</a>)&mdash;very
bad grinding.</p>

<p>It is an easy matter to test your grinding by
occasionally placing the blade of a try square on
the bevel. If it is not straight, your grinding needs
more care. Too much stress cannot be laid on the
importance of this subject of grinding. It is the
key-note of success. If you are careless in this
particular, your work at the bench cannot be a
success. "A good workman is known by his tools."</p>

<p>After grinding comes sharpening. This is done
by rubbing the bevelled side back and forth a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>times on an oilstone, lubricated with a few drops of
sperm or light machine oil.</p>

</div>

<p>The stone should be wiped off, afterward, and
should never be saturated with the oil. If this is
allowed to happen, the surface becomes gummed
(<a href="#fig114">Fig. 114</a>) and loses its cutting edge. This rubbing
will sometimes turn over a thin wire edge, which
is removed by laying the tool with the flat side on the
oilstone and drawing it toward you. The wire
edge can be further removed if necessary by stropping
on a piece of leather.</p>

<p>Before replacing the cutter in the plane, the cap
iron is fastened on the flat side about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch from
the cutting edge; but this distance may be varied
for different woods.</p>

<p>The object of the cap iron is to prevent a splitting
action by bending the shaving forward, as shown
in <a href="#fig115">Fig. 115</a>. At <i>a</i> is shown the effect when there
is no cap, and at <i>b</i> the splinter bent over giving

<small>SQUARING UP STOCK</small></h2>


<p>Having prepared Harry for the serious work
to come by his explanation of the plane
and its operation, Ralph prepared to start
his pupil on the most important and difficult problem
in shopwork&mdash;squaring up stock.</p>

<p>"Anybody," he said "can hack away at a piece
of wood with tools, and get some kind of result,
but if this work is worth doing at all, it is worth
doing well, and to be able to square up stock is
perhaps the most important operation you will
ever do. It is like mathematics, the answer is
either right or wrong. When you finish, the stock
is either square or not square.</p>

<p>"To square up stock means to reduce it to three
definite dimensions, length, breadth, and thickness,
with all adjoining edges or surfaces at right angles.
It sounds easy.</p>

<p>"Suppose we want a piece 12 inches &times; 2 inches &times;
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch. First, saw out your stock about 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches &times; 1 inch. This allows something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>each way for the tools to remove in the process&mdash;for
sawdust and shavings. It is considerably more
than necessary, but on the first trial you waste more
than later, when you have become skilled in this work.</p>

<p>"Second. Dress down one of the flat faces with the
jack plane; follow with the smoothing plane and
test, with straight edge, with the grain, across it,
and diagonally across corners. When this face is
finished it constitutes the foundation of the process,
and is called the 'working face.'</p>

<p>"Third. Make a pencil mark on the working face
near one of the edges. This is called a witness mark,
and it indicates that the edge it touches is to be the
next face dressed.</p>

<p>"Fourth. Dress down the edge, making it square
with the working face, and testing its whole length
with the try square. This is the 'joint edge'
(<a href="#fig116">Fig. 116</a>).</p>

<p>"Fifth. Set the marking gauge, as shown in
<a href="#fig117">Fig. 117</a>, holding it in the left hand and the rule
in the right, to two inches, the width of the finished
piece. The reason for this is that the scale on the
gauge stick is sometimes inaccurate.</p>

<p>"With the gauge block against the joint edge, gauge
a line the entire length of the working face. In
doing this, the gauge may be used in either hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>in fact it is well to practise so as to be able to use
either at will. The tool should always be pushed
from you, and at the same time tilted from you,
until the steel point makes only a fine line. If it
is held upright, the point will try to follow the grain,
which is very seldom parallel with the edge.</p>

<a id="fig116"></a><img src="images/fig116.jpg" width="500" height="515" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 116. Steps in the process of squaring up stock</div>

</div>

<p>"You have now laid out on the working face your
first dimension&mdash;the width.</p>

<p>"Sixth. Plane down the edge opposite to the joint
edge, almost to the gauge line just drawn. Remember
that the tendency is always to take off too much,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>and when a piece is too small there is no way of
making it larger, but if it is left a little too large,
it is a simple matter to take off one more shaving.
In other words, always be on the safe side, and take
off too little rather than too much. Test this
edge to see that it is square with working face before
reaching the gauge line. Get into the habit of
marking all high spots with a pencil, and planing
out the marks.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 117. &quot;Setting&quot; the marking gauge</div>
</div>

<p>"Seventh. Set the gauge at the required thickness,
in this case <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch&mdash;and with gauge block against
working face, make a line full length on both of
the squared edges.</p>

<p>"Eighth. Dress down the remaining rough face
to or near both gauge lines just drawn, and test
with straight edge, as in the working face. The
stock is now to the second dimension&mdash;thickness.</p>

<p>"Ninth. Secure the last dimension&mdash;length. As
near one end as possible make a line across the
working face with a knife and try square, and continue
it around the four sides back to the starting place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>If it does not come out exactly at this point, the
stock is not square.</p>

<p>"From this knife line, measure off the length on the
working face, and square a knife line on the four
sides, as on the first end. Block-plane both ends
to the knife lines, and test.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 118. The shooting board</div>
</div>

<p>"If these nine successive steps are carried out
accurately, the answer is correct," as Ralph remarked
after Harry had worked faithfully throughout
the whole explanation.</p>

<p>The boys realized that they needed a shooting
board as a necessary
part of their equipment,
and after Ralph
had worked out the
drawing shown in Fig.
118, Harry was told to
square up the four
pieces of stock to be
used in its construction.</p>

<p>"Now let me show you a new trick," said Ralph.
"It is always a good plan after making a drawing
to write out a bill of material something like this:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="bill of material">
<tr><td align="left">1 pc. pine 14 &times; 8 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></td>
   <td class="tpl">1 pc. pine 6 &times; 2 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1 pc. maple 14 &times; 6 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></td>
   <td class="tpl">4 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch f. h. screws</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1 pc. pine 8 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></td>
   <td class="tpl">5 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch f. h. screws</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>"There you have in a nutshell all the items
needed for the shooting board, and you can proceed
to square all your pieces to these dimensions without
consulting the drawing until you are ready to assemble
the parts. The five <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch screws are for
fastening the maple pieces to the flat piece of pine,
and the 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  screws to fasten the cleats. All the
holes for screws are to be bored and countersunk."</p>

<p>"What's countersunk?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>This led to a talk on screws and boring tools, and
as it is valuable to the young worker in wood,
we will give it as fully as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig119"></a><img src="images/fig119.jpg" width="600" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 119. The use of screws</div>

</div>

<p>"There are several kinds of screws," began Ralph,
"but the two most commonly used are flat heads
and round heads. (<a href="#fig119">Fig. 119</a>). Flat-head screws
are those we generally think of, but unless the hole
which has been bored or drilled is reamed out at the
top, countersunk as we call it, the screw head will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>stand out from the surface ready to tear your
clothes and to scratch anything it may come in
contact with, so you can readily see the importance
of sinking them below the surface.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, there are often cases where we
have no desire to hide the screw. The round heads
are used for such cases, and because of their shape
they do not catch hold of things. These screws are
usually blued&mdash;treated with acid to give them a
dull, more artistic colour. Screws treated in this
way do not rust as readily as the bright ones. You
can buy brass screws in both flat and round
head forms; in fact you can get tinned, Japanned,
lacquered, bronzed, copper, nickel, and
even silver plated screws&mdash;if you have the
money.</p>

<p>"In buying them, you must always give two
numbers&mdash;the length, in inches, and the diameter.
This is the diameter of the wire forming the body
and runs from 0 to 30, number 0 being about
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch.</p>

<p>"A one-inch screw No. 8 would be fatter or larger
in diameter than a one-inch No. 6, which is of comparatively
slight or thin proportions. They are
sold in boxes containing a gross.</p>

<p>"In fastening two pieces of wood together, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
should be prepared as shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig119">Fig. 119</a>)
for a flat head and as at <i>b</i> for a round head.
The screw slips through the first board, and the
screw threads engage only in the second in each
case."</p>

<br />
<small>BORING TOOLS</small></h2>


<p>"Boring tools are very interesting," said
Ralph. The brace and bit for soft woods
have practically taken the place of the old
fashioned augers, gimlets, etc. The reason is not hard
to find. An auger or gimlet could bore but one size
of hole, while with a brace and set of bits almost
any diameter can be secured. A little later on,
I'll tell you about a Yankee invention along this
line.</p>

<p>"The brace is a sort of universal tool holder, and
any tool designed to fit into it is known as a bit,
as for example a countersink bit, or a screw driver
bit, and several varieties of drills.</p>

<p>"The shank, or part that fits into the brace, is
usually square and tapering, and the part of the
brace which engages this shank is called the 'chuck.'
(<a href="#fig120">Fig. 120</a>.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="fig120"></a><img src="images/fig120.jpg" width="200" height="518" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 120. Gimlet bit and centre bit</div>

</div>

<p>"The centre bit, an old-fashioned form, had all the
necessary features of a good boring tool but one.
It had a sharp centre for accurately locating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>hole, a knife edge for cutting the fibres, and a chisel
for removing the wood, but it lacked the spiral
screw thread of the modern tool, and
had to be forced through the wood by
main strength. On a modern auger bit,
this spiral screw relieves the worker of
a large part of the labour; all he has to
do is to turn the brace and keep it
straight, supposing of course that the
bit is sharp. (<a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>.)</p>

<p>"The auger bit is most commonly
used by woodworkers. It has two
knife edges and two chisels besides the
spiral spur in the centre. A short form
of this tool, called the dowel bit, has
the advantage of bending less readily
than the ordinary auger bit. The size in sixteenths
of an inch is stamped into the metal shank, but if
this number is not distinct or for any reason is
missing, the diameter may be measured by holding
the rule across the knife edges."</p>

<a id="fig121"></a><img src="images/fig121.jpg" width="400" height="58" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 121. The auger bit</div>

</div>

<p>"What's the Yankee invention you were going
to tell me about?" interrupted Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>"Well, suppose you wanted to bore a large hole,
say 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches in diameter, the probabilities are
that you wouldn't have a bit that size. In fact,
to have a full set of bits from <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch up to 3 inches
would mean a very expensive lot of tools. This
difficulty has been overcome by a very clever
invention called the extension or expansive bit.
(<a href="#fig122">Fig. 122</a>). On this tool the knife edge and chisel
are part of a moving lip, which may be fastened
at any desired point by means of a set screw.</p>

<p>"Besides being adjustable in diameter, the lip of
the bit has a scale, and the body a single line engraved
on it. By bringing this line to the various measurements
on the scale, you can set it to a definite size
without the trouble of measuring it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig122"></a><img src="images/fig122.jpg" width="400" height="70" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 122. The expansive bit</div>

</div>

<p>"The tool has certain limitations, of course. It
is made in two sizes; one will bore holes of any size
from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch up to 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches, and the other any
size from <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch
to 3 inches, while
extra lips or cutters
are made to bore as large as 4 inches, but
if you ever try to bore a hole of this size you will
want all your muscle."</p>

<p>The screw-driver bit is simply a screw-driver with
a bit shank instead of a wood handle, and the counter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>sink
has a cone-shaped end with enough grooves
cut in it to give one or more cutting edges. Its
use was illustrated
in making the
bench hook and
shooting board.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig123"></a><img src="images/fig123.jpg" width="400" height="94" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 123. The Forstner bit</div>

</div>

<p>The gimlet bit may be used for boring holes for
screws. It is made from <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>  inch up to <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>  inch,
and is valuable for preparing articles for the smaller-sized
screws where the auger bit would be too large.</p>

<p>We find for sale drill bits for electricians, warranted
to go through a nail if necessary, and dozens
of special bits.</p>

<p>In working with thin wood, the auger bit is very
apt to split it, especially brittle woods, like red gum.
Even this contingency is provided for in the Forstner
bit, which will bore a hole in a sheet of paper (<a href="#fig123">Fig.
123</a>), and is therefore very valuable for work in
veneering or other very thin material.</p>

<p>The brace is represented by several styles and
makers, but the beginner must look for the same
qualities in the brace as he would in any other
tool&mdash;good workmanship and material, simplicity
and durability.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned Spofford brace was strong,
simple, and reliable. For working in corners or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
any place where a full revolution of the tool is not
possible, a ratchet attachment is necessary. This
is found on most of the modern tools, and may be
obtained at any hardware store. (<a href="#fig124">Fig. 124</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The hand drill (<a href="#fig125">Fig. 125</a>) is one of the most useful
tools any one can have about the shop or the house.
To be able to make holes in soft or hard wood, tin,
zinc, brass, copper, or iron is certainly a great advantage,
and some form of the tool should be in every
establishment. Our boys found it useful in making
moving toys, wind vanes, anemometers, and dozens
of other pieces, and never regretted its cost. It
may be bought for fifty cents and upward, a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>good one costing about $1.50. The drills designed
to be used with this tool vary by <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub>  inch, beginning
with <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub>  inch up to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch. Above this a larger
chuck is required. They have round shanks instead
of the ordinary square bit shank.</p>

<small>MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS</small></h2>


<h3>THE SCREW-DRIVER</h3>

<p>The need of a screw-driver is too obvious to
require special mention. They are made
with blades from two inches up to thirty
inches long, and have round, flat, or corrugated
handles. The best grip is obtained on either a flat
or corrugated one, and two sizes are desirable, a
small one with about a three-inch blade, the other
with an eight or ten. (<a href="#fig126">Fig. 126</a>.)</p>

<p>Some of the magazine brad awls containing a
dozen awls and screw-driver are very convenient,
but the combinations supposed to contain a whole
tool outfit, including saws, are poor investments.</p>

<p>Ratchet screw-drivers, from which the hand is not
removed during the operation of driving or withdrawing
a screw, are on the market, but they are
luxuries rather than necessities.</p>

<p>Pliers with wire-cutting attachments are convenient,
and should be added to the kit when possible; some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>them are powerful enough to cut a heavy wire nail.
(<a href="#fig127">Fig. 127</a>.)</p>

<p><i>The Mallet.</i> This simple tool is made in a
dozen different forms for various trades. The round-headed
kind is perhaps the cheapest.
It is made of hickory or lignum vit&aelig;.
(<a href="#fig128">Fig. 128</a>.)</p>

<p>The best form for woodwork has an
oblong or square head of lignum vit&aelig;.
The handle should pass
clear through the head and
be fastened with a wedge.</p>

</div>

<p>A blow from this tool
does not shatter the tool
handle as would a blow
from a hammer. A comparison
of the two blows
might be likened to the action of gun
powder and dynamite. The slow burning
powder represents the action of the
mallet. The hammer should never be
used on a chisel or gouge.</p>

<p>Hand screws for holding glued-up
work together, sometimes for holding special work
on the bench top, are made of wood, with either wood
or metal spindles. For ordinary work, the jaws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>should be parallel, but special forms are on the market
which will hold irregular forms, as shown in <a href="#fig129">Fig. 129</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 128. The mallet</div>

</div>

<p>They are made in several sizes, from little ones
with 4-inch jaws up to 22-inch jaws. For large
and heavy work, clamps of wood or metal may be
had as large as eight feet in length. They are useful
in the making of drawing boards, doors, etc., but
are not a real necessity for boys' ordinary woodwork.
Clamps in the
form of trestles
for specially important
large
work are made
as large as
twelve feet in
length.</p>

<p>For ordinary
purposes, a pair
of 6-inch and a
pair of 12 or 14
inch wood hand
screws will answer. The ingenuity of the young
woodworker will suggest other ways of holding glued-up
work in the absence of hand screws, such as winding
with heavy twine or rope, and twisting a stick
through the strands, after the old method of tighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>ing
a buck saw or turning saw. In building up a
drawing board and gluing the strips together, the
requisite pressure may be obtained by laying it on
the floor between blocks temporarily nailed there,
and wedges driven in, after the method described
for picture frames.</p>

<p>A large part of the value derived from woodwork
is in the exercise of ingenuity required to meet
unexpected contingencies. Just so the owner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>an automobile learns more about mechanics and
the construction of his machine by being obliged
to make repairs on the road, miles from any repair
shop, and with a limited number of tools and appliances.</p>


<h3>THE HAMMER</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 130. Hammers</div>

</div>

<p>This common tool is made in at least thirty different
forms, and some styles in nine or ten different
weights. For woodwork, the adze-eye claw hammer,
weight sixteen ounces, will
answer all requirements.
For use with brads as small
as <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch, a brad hammer
of three or four ounces is
desirable. Both of these
forms are provided with
claws for withdrawing
nails. (<a href="#fig130">Fig. 130</a>.)</p>

<p>Claw hammers are comparatively
modern inventions,
and there are men
now living who, when
serving their apprenticeship, were obliged to withdraw
their nails with a pair of pinchers. At that
period all nails were wrought by hand, and houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>are standing to-day on which the clapboards are still
held in place by nails forged on an anvil by hand.</p>


<h3>THE FILE</h3>

<p>A volume might be written about the various
shapes, sizes, and methods of cutting of this tool.
Its place in woodwork is limited, and it should
never be used where another tool will do the work.
Like sand-paper, it has a tendency to lead to bad
habits and slovenly work. On certain pieces of
curved work in hard wood it may be used to remove
the sharp edges left by chisel or gouge, especially
the latter, but its action even there is apt to tear
away the fibres.</p>

<p>An eight-inch, half-round, cabinet wood file and an
eight-inch, round, slim No. 0 cut Swiss pattern file
are sufficient.</p>

<p>For sharpening bits, a special auger bit file is made,
and this may be used for sharpening the marking
gauge point and such small work. For sharpening
saw teeth, triangular saw files are sold at all hardware
stores.</p>


<h3>THE SPIRIT LEVEL</h3>

<p>This is necessary on outdoor structures which are
to be placed on foundations, in securing level or
horizontal timbers, and in plumbing the uprights.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>The human eye is not equal to the task. Masons
and builders make use of wooden plumb rods, but
as the level is necessary to secure the horizontals,
it will be at hand for the uprights, the two glass
tubes being at right angles. (<a href="#fig131">Fig. 131</a>.)</p>

all ordinary requirements. (<a href="#fig132">Fig. 132</a>.)</p>

<small>MAKING NAIL BOXES</small></h2>


<p>The boys now became very busy completing
their shop equipment, and the first project
was a box for holding different sizes of
nails. This was to be kept on the bench where
it could be reached conveniently, and it is shown
in <a href="#fig133">Fig. 133</a>.</p>

<p>After studying the sketch, Harry made out the
bill of material:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="boill of material">

<div class="caption">Fig. 133. The nail box</div>

</div>

<p>These six pieces were squared up, and the joints
for the two partitions laid out by placing them edge
to edge in the vise.
Pencil lines were
drawn across the
faces at random, <i>a</i>.
Ralph explained
that by fitting these
pencil lines they
could at any time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>bring the two pieces together in the original
position.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="fig134"></a><img src="images/fig134.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 134. Socket chisels</div>

</div>

<p>The four knife lines representing the edges of the
grooves were next
drawn, and squared
half-way down on
each edge, using
the face with the
pencil lines as a
working face. The bottom of the groove was
laid off with the marking gauge set at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch.
The wood inside the lines was removed by making
a saw cut just inside the knife lines, and cutting out
with a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch chisel.</p>

<p>This led to a talk on chisels. Ralph explained
that for fine work a "firmer" chisel was used,
having a comparatively thin body.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of handles, known as "socket"
and "tang." The chisels having "tangs" should
never be hammered, as the tang acts as a wedge
and splits the handle. Where blows are to be struck
with the mallet, a socket handle should be used.
(<a href="#fig134">Fig. 134</a>.) For heavy work, where hard blows are
to be struck, as in house-framing, and out-of-door
work generally, the heavy framing tool should be
used. The handle of this chisel has a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>iron ring near the top to keep it from going to
pieces.</p>

<p>Our boys' equipment at this time consisted of one
half-inch and a one-inch firmer chisel with tang
handles, a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch socket firmer, and
one <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch framing chisel. Later on they added
a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch firmer with tang handle.</p>

<p>The grooves for the nail box were cut with the
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch chisel without the aid of the mallet.</p>

<p>Ralph showed how, by inclining the tool at a
slight angle, a paring action could be obtained, and
by working from both ends of the groove no corners
were destroyed.</p>

<p>When the four grooves were finished, the box was
ready for assembling. This called for hammer and
nails.</p>

<p>Wire nails are so cheap now that the old-fashioned
cut nails have been largely driven from the market.</p>

<p>The nails used on the box were one-inch brads.</p>

<p>The holding power of flat-head nails is of course
much greater than bung head, but in this case the
box was to be squared up after nailing, exactly as
if it were a solid block of wood. This meant planing
the sides and ends, and as the nails would ruin the
plane iron, they were all sunk below the surface
with a nail set or punch. (<a href="#fig135">Fig. 135</a>). This is a useful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>tool, but not absolutely necessary, as for light work
a wire nail, with the point ground flat on the grindstone,
will answer the same purpose. A carpenter
frequently uses the edge of a flat-head nail instead
of the punch.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The box was assembled by nailing together the
sides and ends. The bottom was next put on,
holding the try square along one
side and end to make sure everything
was square, and last of all
the two partitions were
pushed down into their
grooves, and tied in
place by one brad from
each side. Next, all
nails were set, and the
outside tested with the
try square and trued
up with the plane.</p>

</div>

<p>The cabinet of drawers shown
in <a href="#fig136">Fig. 136</a> was next designed to
keep the assortment of screws and nails, which
the boys knew would soon accumulate. As far as
possible, they were kept in their original paper boxes,
on which the sizes were plainly printed.</p>

<p>The twelve drawers were simply boxes without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>covers or partitions, and Ralph suggested that it
was not necessary to make them all at once, but
that they could often fill in spare time that way,
and gradually complete the dozen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig136"></a><img src="images/fig136.jpg" width="600" height="441" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 136. Cabinet for nails and screws</div>

</div>

<p>After making the nail box with partitions, this
was a simple job, it being only important that they
all be of the same size.</p>

<p>The construction of the cabinet, however, brought
new problems. The shelves, being short, did not
require any vertical support except at the ends,
where they were gained into the sides, and to give
Harry practice the top and bottom were to be
"rabbeted" into the sides. The sides then were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>the most important parts. All six pieces were first
squared up to the dimensions called for in the
drawing. The list of material was as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="materials">
<tr><td align="left">4 pcs. 24<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 12 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> shelves</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2 pcs. 14  &times; 12 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ends</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1 pcs. 25<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 14 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> back</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"The grain must run the long way," said Ralph,
"so the grooves will be across the grain."</p>

<p>The four grooves were laid out with knife and
try square, and the lines scored as deeply with the
knife as possible.</p>

<p>Then another cut was made with the knife inside
of the first, and with the knife held at about 45
degrees, cutting out a V-shaped groove, as shown at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>In each of these grooves a cut with the buck saw
was made down to the line, and the wood removed
with the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch chisel. There are special planes,
called rabbet planes, and plows for doing this kind
of work, but it is good practice for beginners to use
the chisel.</p>

<p>The grooves finished, the cabinet was put together
with 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch brads, except the back. This
being of thin material, and having no special strain
on it, was nailed on with 1-inch brads. The total
width of the drawers in each tier was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>than the space. This gave clearance, so that they
could be moved in or out easily.</p>

<p>Later, when all twelve drawers were finished, the
boys bought a dozen simple drawer pulls, and
screwed one in the centre of each box.</p>

<p>The centre was found by drawing the diagonals
in light pencil lines. The front and ends were
sand-papered, and given two coats of dark-green
stain, and the cabinet was placed on a shelf against
the wall.</p>

<br />
<small>BIRD HOUSES</small></h2>


<p>The boys felt that they were ready for business,
and Ralph suggested that they had
provided enough weather vanes and windmills,
but had made no provisions for the birds.</p>

<p>The cat, that arch enemy of the native birds,
had driven the robins, martins, and wrens all away.
Each year some of these brave little birds started
homes in the trees near the house only to have their
families devoured as soon as they were hatched.</p>

<p>A bird house to be attractive need not be very
pretentious, but it must absolutely be cat-proof,
or the birds will inspect it carefully from all points
of view and leave it severely alone. A nest well
hidden in the tree foliage or shrubbery is not nearly
so conspicuous as a brightly painted house fastened
to the limbs of a tree. The side of a barn or outhouse,
far enough down from the roof so that the
cat cannot reach it, or a tall pole covered on the
upper part with tin, so that the feline bird hunter
cannot gain a foothold, are about the only safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>places for a house which the birds will actually
adopt. The first house our woodworkers manufactured
is shown in <a href="#fig137">Fig. 137</a>.</p>

<p>This was a single or one-family house, and its
construction was very simple.</p>

<p>The list of material follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="list of materials">
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">One pc. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> -inch pine or white wood 10 &times; 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Two pcs. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> -inch pine or white wood 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  ins.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The first piece, 10 &times; 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches, was simply squared
up for the bottom. The two pieces for the sides,
7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 3 inches, were squared up, and one edge of
each planed to a 45-degree bevel, to engage with
the roof boards.</p>

<p>The latter were squared up, and nailed together
at right angles with 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads.</p>

<p>The two ends, 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches, were carefully
laid out as shown in the drawing, sawed, and planed
to the lines with square edges.</p>

<p>In the end which was to contain the circular door
a hole 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches in diameter was bored with its
centre two inches from the bottom line. This
required the services of the extension bit, and, to
avoid splitting the wood, as soon as the spur of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>bit showed on the further side, the wood was turned
about, and the hole finished from the other side.</p>

<p>The house was next turned upside down, and
fastened in the bench vise. Holes were drilled
along the sides of the bottom piece <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch in from
the edge&mdash;three on each side&mdash;countersunk, and
the piece fastened to the sides with 1-inch No. 8
screws. The top pieces already nailed together were
now nailed in position on the sides and ends with
1-inch brads.</p>

<p>The pole they used was 13 feet long and about 3
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>inches in diameter at the small end. It was
rounded at this end by using a draw knife. (<a href="#fig138">Fig. 138</a>).
A block of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch pine was bored out, and fitted
snugly over the end of the pole. This block was
then removed, and four holes bored through it for
screws.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 138. The draw knife</div>

</div>

<p>Before replacing the block on the top of the pole
a cut was made across the end of the pole about
two inches deep, by means of the rip saw.</p>

<p>The block was replaced, and wooden wedges
driven into the saw cut. This fastened the block
securely on the end of the pole, and after making
sure that it was level, the bird house was fastened
to the block by four 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch screws from the under
side.</p>

<p>A piece of sheet tin was wound around just under
the house to discourage pussy, and the pole set into
the ground about three feet, bringing the under
side of the house ten feet above the ground.</p>

<p>A double or two-family house of similar propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>tions
was built next, as shown in <a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>. The list
of material called for:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="material">
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">One pc. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch wood 18<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> (bottom)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">One pc. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch wood 18<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> (roof)</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The construction was the same as before, each
end having a door, and the partition of course being
solid. The block for supporting the house on the
pole was larger, being 8 &times; 5 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches, and called
for six 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch No. 10 screws, to secure it to the
under side of the floor. Harry wanted to make
it more complete by adding a small wind vane, but
Ralph said it might frighten the birds, so it was
omitted.</p>

<p>Of course larger and more ornamental houses
may be built, but where there are too many families
in such close proximity there is apt to be trouble,
while houses that are too conspicuous do not appeal
to the beautiful American wild birds that we want
to attract. With the English sparrow it does not
matter so much. For these birds, a tenement house
against the side of a barn may be built easily, in
the form shown in <a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>.</p>

<p>This may be made any length, each door leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>to a compartment separated from the others by
partitions. Make as many pieces plus one as there
are to be compartments, apartments, or flats; have
the bottom project as shown in side view for a
perch and walk, and have the roof also project to
shed rain.</p>

<p>If not fastened from the inside of the barn by
stout screws, this house must be secured to a shelf,
or by brackets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="fig139"></a><img src="images/fig139.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 139. Two family house and tenement</div>

</div>

<p>The side view shows a simple shelf made of a
back piece secured to the side of the barn by screws
or nails, a plain shelf nailed to this back piece, and
two wooden brackets. If iron brackets are used,
both the shelf and back piece may be omitted, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>brackets being fastened to the under side of the
bird house and to the siding of the barn by
screws.</p>

<p>For birds like the high-hole, or flicker, a piece
of hollow log, or an elongated box fastened securely
to the side of a pole, made cat proof,
is very acceptable. This should
not be painted, but should be provided
with a door on the side
and a perch. (<a href="#fig137">Fig. 137</a>.) The opening
should be about three inches for
these large birds, and the location
should be as secluded as possible.
Any number of devices will suggest
themselves, but always remember
the cat, and study the location from
the bird point of view. The martins and swallows
are especially to be encouraged, as they are wonderful
destroyers of insects.</p>

<small>SIMPLE ARTICLES FOR HOUSEHOLD USE</small></h2>


<p>The boys thought it was about time to pay
some attention to the wants of the family,
who had been clamouring for weeks to have
this article or that for the kitchen, dining room, and
in fact for every part of the house.</p>

<p>Ralph was a wise teacher, however. He knew
that the cause of ninety out of every hundred
failures was due to the young mechanic's trying
some problem too far advanced.</p>

<p>It seems strange that people cannot learn this lesson.
We have seen hundreds of boys led along,
say in carving, from one simple lesson to another,
until at the end of five or six carefully graded exercises,
these boys could carve beautifully any design
given them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have seen boys start in
on their own hook, without any direction from older
people, and ruining everything they tried, simply
because they wanted to do the most difficult thing
first, before they had developed any skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>Ralph was determined that his boy should be an
expert and successful user of tools, so he paid no
attention to the clamours of the family, and allowed
Harry to make only those things which were within
his power to do well. Each time a piece of work was
finished, and inspected by the family, the universal
chorus was something like this:</p>

<p>"Well, if he can make such a fine bird house, I
don't see why he can't make half a dozen picture
frames for these water colors," or, "If he can make
such a fine pen tray, I don't see why he can't make
a new stool for the piano!"</p>

<p>In vain Ralph explained that these things could
be made in due time, that a picture frame required
much more skill than a bird house, etc.</p>

<p>Their household articles commenced with a bread
board for the kitchen. (<a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>). This gave Harry
his first experience in planing a broad surface. He
used jack and smoothing planes for the working
face, and squared the rest of the board as he had
smaller pieces. This required some time. The
wood about the semi-circular top was removed with
saw and chisel, the board held for the chiselling flat
on the bench hook. After getting this curve as
true as possible with the chisel, it was finished with
a sand-paper block. A <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch hole was bored at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>centre of the semi-circle to hang it up by, and the
two lower corners were rounded with chisel and sand-paper.
No sand-paper was used on the flat surface,
as Ralph explained this was a board for cutting
bread, and the grit from the sand-paper would become
more or less embedded in the wood, and it would
spoil the bread knife. Sand-paper is made of
ground quartz, and it soon dulls the edge of a cutting
tool.</p>

<p>The knife and fork box (<a href="#fig142">Fig. 142</a>) brought new

<p>It was made of white wood, and, after being assembled,
was stained a rich brown by receiving two
coats of bichromate of potash. This is a chemical,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>which may be bought at a paint or drug store in
the form of crystals. These are dissolved in water,
until the solution looks like pink lemonade. It
can be applied with a brush, but each coat must
be allowed to dry
completely before
the whole is sand-papered
smooth with
No. 0 sand-paper.
A deeper brown can
be obtained by adding
one or two extra
coats of stain.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 142. Method of using hand screws in the construction of a knife box</div>
</div>

<p>The middle partition
containing the
handle was made
first. The drawing
was laid out on the
wood after it had
been squared up, and
two holes 1 inch in
diameter were bored
out at <i>a a</i>. The
wood between was taken out with a key-hole saw, and
finished to the line with chisel and knife. A turning
saw can be used to advantage on this handle, but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>not absolutely necessary. Spaces <i>b b</i> were removed
in the same way, but a knife was used in the concave
part of the curve. If it is handy, a small
spokeshave can be employed on the whole upper
line of this handle.</p>

<p>Anything in the nature of a handle should be
rounded to fit the hand. Edges <i>c c</i> were therefore
rounded with the knife, and finished with coarse,
followed by fine, sand-paper.</p>

<p>The two sides were laid out together as in the
nail box, and the groove cut with back saw and
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch chisel.</p>

<p>The end pieces were made in a similar manner,
and the bottom piece squared to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch of finished
size. The assembling consisted of first gluing together
the sides and ends. Two hand screws were
used to hold them. This was Harry's first attempt
at using hand screws, and Ralph showed him the
importance of keeping the jaws parallel.</p>

<p>The box remained in the hand screws over night,
and the next day it was found to be securely fastened.
The most convenient kind of glue for boys is
the liquid sold in cans. It is always ready for
use, and very handy where only a moderate quantity
is needed.</p>

<p>Dry glue in the form of flakes, or granulated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>must be soaked over night, and then heated in a pot
having a double bottom with water in the lower
part.</p>

<p>It should be put on hot with a brush or a small
flat stick. The best glue is none too good, yet a
good quality has wonderful holding power and
should last indefinitely.</p>

<p>After removing the hand screws, the unfinished
box was placed in the vise, tested with the edge of
the plane, and made perfectly true, top and bottom.</p>

<p>The <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch bottom piece was now put on with
one-inch brads, the sides and ends made square,
the handle partition
slipped into the
grooves, and fastened
with two brads
at each end.</p>

<p>This knife box was
so satisfactory that
our young carpenters
resolved to have a
large one for tools.
Whenever they had
a job to do in the
house, they were constantly running out to the shop
for something, so that a tool box became a necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>The construction was similar to the knife box;
but this was larger and heavier, and the dado joints
at the ends were replaced by a butt joint fastened
with flat-head screws. (<a href="#fig143">Fig. 143</a>). The bottom and
partition were also put on with screws, on account
of the weight to be carried.</p>

<p>These tool boxes are frequently made in the shape
shown in <a href="#fig144">Fig. 144</a>, with sloping sides and ends
called the hopper joint; but aside from the tool
practice it affords, it is doubtful if the shape has
advantage enough over the other form to warrant
the extra time it takes. Man is an imitative creature,
however, and what one carpenter has, the others
copy.</p>

<p>The principal features about this useful article
should be size and strength, especially in the handle,
which should be of about <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  or <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch stock.</p>

<br />
<small>THE MITRE BOX AND PICTURE FRAMES</small></h2>


<p>It seemed to Harry that the shop was fairly
well equipped, but Ralph insisted that they
must have a mitre box before making anything
else for the house.</p>

<p>The mitre box is, or should be, an instrument of
precision, and although simple in construction,
must be perfectly accurate, or it is useless. (<a href="#fig145">Fig. 145</a>.)</p>

<p>The illustration shows the common form, but
elaborate affairs of iron and wood can be bought
ready made. Every boy should make his own, for
the practice, if for nothing else. The sides should
be made of oak <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick, 18 inches long, and 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches high, the bottom of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch pine or other soft
wood, the same size.</p>

<p>When squared up, the two sides must be tested by
standing them side by side; then reverse one end
for end, to see if they are alike. If not, find where
the trouble is, and correct it.</p>

<p>It is especially important that the edges of the
bottom piece be square and the sides perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>parallel. This test can be made with the marking
gauge. Sides are fastened on by boring and countersinking
for three screws on each. After assembling,
the whole thing must be tested as if it were a solid
block. Top edges must be true and parallel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig145"></a><img src="images/fig145.jpg" width="600" height="876" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 145. The 45&deg; mitre box and test pieces</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>Near one end&mdash;about two inches in&mdash;lay out
across the top with try square a line 90 degrees
with the sides. Carry the line down each side,
square with the top edges. For 45-degree angles,
lay out a square by drawing two pencil lines across
the top, as far apart as the finished mitre box is
wide. Draw the two diagonals and square lines from
their ends down both sides, taking care that their
position is not over the screw in the bottom; because
as the saw cuts deeper it may reach this
screw and ruin its teeth.</p>

<p>Make the three saw cuts directly on the lines laid
out with a cross cut or back saw, with the utmost
care. If this is not done accurately, all the labour
of preparation is wasted. The blank end of the
mitre box may have an additional 90-degree cut, or
be left for new cuts in the future, as a mitre box of
this description wears out and becomes inaccurate.</p>

<p>Other angles may be used, as 60 degrees or 30 degrees,
but it is better to have these on another box as
they are used less, and for special purposes. (<a href="#fig146">Fig. 146</a>.)</p>

<p>The mitre box is not ready to use until it has been
thoroughly tested. Prepare a strip of soft wood&mdash;pine
or white wood&mdash;1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches wide and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch
thick. Cut four pieces from it on the mitre box,
using the back saw as shown at <i>a</i>, with only one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>the slits. Place these four triangular pieces together
to form a square. All the four mitre
joints of this square must fit perfectly. If they do
not, mark the slit
"N. G.," and test
the other slit in the
same way. If all
right, mark "O. K."
It often happens that
one may be perfect
and the
other inaccurate.
If they are
both O. K., the box is ready for use. If one slit is
useless, lay out and cut another on the blank end
of the mitre box in the same direction, and test
again.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 146. 30-60-90 mitre box</div>
</div>

<p>In testing a 30-degree cut three pieces of the strip
should be sawed out, and when placed together
they should form a perfect equilateral triangle,
while from a 60-degree cut, six pieces are needed to
form a hexagon.</p>

<p>These angles are valuable in inlaid work, and
for getting out geometrical designs.</p>

<p>The 45-degree cut is indispensable in making the
mitred corners of picture frames and in cabinet work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>In making picture frames of simple cross section,
it is first necessary to cut the rabbet (<a href="#fig147">Fig. 147</a>)
with a rabbet plane. If this moulding is made by
hand, the size of the picture should be measured, the
length of all four sides added, and a liberal allowance
made for waste.</p>

<a id="fig147"></a><img src="images/fig147.jpg" width="600" height="287" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 147. Making picture frames</div>

</div>

<p>In the figure, the triangles <i>a a</i> are waste, the
rabbet being indicated by the dotted line. After
the four pieces have been sawed out on the mitre
box, they should be placed together on a flat surface,
such as the bench top or floor, to see if the mitres
fit perfectly. If they do not, one of them can be
block planed to make a perfect fit, and the other
three laid close together, as shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>The assembling is the hardest part of the operation,
and many devices have been tried and some patented
to hold the parts together while the glue is drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>Perhaps the surest way is to drill a hole in one
piece of each joint large enough for the passage of
a wire bung-head nail.</p>

<p>The undrilled piece is placed vertically in the
vise. The drilled piece, after receiving a thin
coat of glue, is brought into position horizontally,
and the nail driven home.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the nail should catch at the first
blow, but the horizontal piece will sometimes slip,
even with the best of care. It is wiser to place this
piece about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch above its final position, to
allow for this slip.</p>

<p>A method sometimes used is to glue near the
ends of each piece a triangular block of wood, as
shown at <i>d</i>. These must be left over night to
harden.</p>

<p>The next day the whole four pieces can be glued
and held together by four hand screws, as shown,
until the glue is thoroughly hard. This method,
of course, can only be used with plain moulding or
that which is square on the outside.</p>

<p>Our boys tried another way that is commonly
practised. They nailed oblong blocks to an old
drawing board, as shown at <i>e e</i>, and then placed the
picture frame in the centre, after gluing the joints,
and driving wedges in between the blocks and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>frame. Paper placed under each joint prevented
the frame from being stuck to the drawing board
by the glue forced out by the pressure.</p>

<p>This paper plan was learned by experience, as
the first frame the boys tried had to be pried up
from the board, and in so doing they broke it at
two of the joints, so that it had to be made again.</p>

<p>It is well to remember in gluing mitre joints that
end grain absorbs more glue than a flat surface.
A priming coat should be applied first, and allowed
to remain a few moments to fill up the pores. The
second coat should hold fast and make a strong
joint, but an excess of glue should always be avoided,
as it must be removed after hardening, and glue soon
takes the edge from the best of tools.</p>

<p>Very fancy frames should be avoided. A bevel
on the outside or inside, or both, is about all the
young woodworker should attempt in the way of
ornamentation. Depend on the natural beauty
of the wood, as a fancy frame draws the attention
from the picture, which after all is the main thing.
We should admire the man, not his clothes, the
picture not its frame, although the latter should
be neat and well made.</p>

<p>The finishing and polishing of frames is taken
up in <a href="#XLIX">Chapter XLIX</a>.</p>

<br />
<small>MAKING TOILET BOXES</small></h2>


<p>To make a wooden box sounds like a simple
proposition; but in making the drawing,
the questions of size, proportion, joints,
hinges, etc., immediately come up.</p>

<p>The size of course depends on the purpose of
the box. If it is for ladies' gloves, it should be
long and narrow; if for collars or handkerchiefs,
square or nearly so. The height is nearly always
made too great. In fact, the whole question of
proportion is one which can hardly be taught; it
must be felt, and different people have different
ideas as to what constitutes good proportion.</p>

<p>Some hints, however, may be given: A box
perfectly square does not look well. Again, dimensions
that are multiples do not look well. A box
4 &times; 8 &times; 12 inches would not be nearly so pleasing
as one 3 &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 12 inches.</p>

<p>The proportions are also affected by the constructive
details. Is the box to be flat on the sides
and ends or is the top to project? etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Our boys argued and sketched and finally drew
the design shown at <a href="#fig148">Fig. 148</a>. This was to hold
ties. The top was to project and have a bevel,
or chamfer,
also the bottom.
No
hinges were
to be used, but the cover
was to have cleats fastened
on the under side to
keep it in place, and to
prevent warping.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="fig148"></a><img src="images/fig148.jpg" width="500" height="248" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 148. Dado joint used in box design</div>

</div>

<p>The next question was the manner of fastening
the sides and ends. On unimportant work, a butt
joint with glue and brads can be used, but for a
toilet article, the holes made by the brads,
even if they are filled with putty, are not
satisfactory.</p>

<p>So it was decided to use the dado joint as shown at
<i>a</i>. This meant more fine work, but, as Ralph suggested,
it was to last a lifetime, and should be made
right.</p>

<p>Sides and ends were squared up, and the grooves
on the side pieces laid out as in the nail box. The
rabbets on the end pieces were cut out with the back
saw and chisel. After the joints had been carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>fitted, the four pieces were glued together and placed
in hand screws over night.</p>

<p>While the glue was hardening, the two pieces for
the top and bottom were squared up and bevelled
with the smoothing plane on the long sides, the
block plane on the ends.</p>

<p>The cleats for the top were next made, drilled
and countersunk for the screws as at <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>A careful full-sized drawing of half of the top
was made, and a chip carving design drawn for it.
The cleats were not put on until the carving was
finished and short screws had to be used so they
would not come through and spoil the surface.</p>

<p>The next day the body of the box was removed
from the hand screws and squared with a smoothing
plane. The top and bottom were put on with
1-inch brads. These were "set" with a nail punch
to prevent any possible scratching and the
whole box was rubbed down with wax dissolved in
turpentine.</p>

<p>For fine cabinet work, the dovetail joint makes
the most satisfactory method of fastening, but Harry
was not yet skilled enough to do the fine work it
demanded.</p>

<p>The second box was for handkerchiefs, dimensions
8 &times; 7 &times; 3 inches outside, and no overhang at either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>top or bottom. The construction brought in several
new features. Sides and ends were dadoed together
as in the first box.</p>

<p>The top and bottom, after being squared, were
rabbeted on all four sides until they fitted snugly
into the opening top and bottom. They were
glued in these positions and placed in hand screws
over night. (<a href="#fig149">Fig. 149</a>.)</p>

<p>"How are you going to get into that box?" asked
Harry. "You've closed it up solid and glued the top
on."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," was all the satisfaction he got.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig149"></a><img src="images/fig149.jpg" width="600" height="260" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 149. The handkerchief box</div>

</div>

<p>The next day the hand screws were removed and
the box squared up exactly as if it had been a solid
piece of wood. Ralph then made two gauge lines
around the four sides, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch from the top and
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch apart. Then he cut the box in two
between these two lines with a rip saw, after slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>rounding all corners except the bottom ones with
a plane and sand-paper.</p>

<p>By this method, the box and cover must be exactly
alike in outline, and by planing to the gauge lines,
they will fit perfectly.</p>

<p>It only remained to hinge the two parts together,
but this operation proved to be no slight task.</p>

<p>The body was placed in the vise and the cover
laid upside down on the bench top. The two parts
were brought together as shown at <i>c</i>, and the four
knife lines laid out as shown with knife and try
square.</p>

<p>The distance between the lines at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> must
be equal to the width of the hinge, and the wood
between these lines removed to a depth equal to
half the thickness of the hinge at its joint when
closed. If too much is removed, the box will be
"hinge bound" and will not close in front. If
too little is taken out, it will close in front and have
an open joint at the back. In the former case,
a thickness or two of paper placed under the hinge
will often be enough to make it close in front. In
the latter case, of course more material must be
cut out. It is a delicate operation, as the depth of
these cuts for 1-inch hinges is only about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch.
It is a question of accuracy, pure and simple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>Holes for the screws can be made with a
brad awl.</p>

<p>The boys made several boxes of various sizes and
styles, some plain, some decorated with carving.
Pyrography, or burnt work, is frequently used for
decoration, and the
best wood for this
purpose is basswood,
because of
its white color,
softness, and freedom
from pitch.</p>

<p>Other woods
may be burnt,
but pine, which
has veins of pitchy
sap, is not suitable.</p>

because of the beauty of its colouring and its suitability
for carving. The joints used and the method
of construction were the same as in the handkerchief
box, but it was provided with a tray for the
instruments. This was one inch deep over all, and
rested on two thin strips fastened to the ends inside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>These strips were 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches, and, by raising

etc. The cover was decorated with a border and

<small>BRACKETS AND BOOK RACKS</small></h2>


<p>Brackets are often required about the
house for many purposes, and their size,
shape, and decoration are infinite. There is
even more fun in designing them than in making them.
Tastes differ in this respect, as in everything else,
and, given the problem, no two people will bring
out the same design unless they simply copy something
they have seen, which is not designing.</p>

<p>When our boys started to make brackets in response
to urgent demands from the family, Ralph
blocked out the sketch shown in <a href="#fig151">Fig. 151</a> at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>"There is a bracket," he said; "it consists of
three pieces, and properly put together it will hold
what it is designed to hold. It is not a thing of
beauty, and we must improve it. How? By
changing its outline without impairing its strength.
In other words, we must '<i>design</i>' a bracket constructed
of three pieces of wood put together at
right angles. There's your problem; now take paper
and pencil and let us see what you can do."

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>"What size?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, in this case, I'll leave it to your judgment."</p>

<p>For fully an hour, no sound was heard in the shop
but that of two lead pencils. Harry was getting
experience.</p>

<p>"Let me give you a pointer," said Ralph. "Don't
try to draw both sides alike, as it is very difficult
where you have free-hand lines. Draw a vertical
line representing the centre. Sketch one half of the
design, and when you have it about right, fold the
paper on this centre line and trace the other half."</p>

<p>Harry went to work again and at the end of another
hour produced the sketches shown in <a href="#fig151">Fig. 151</a>.</p>

<p>Ralph criticised them all rather severely, and as
Harry was tired, this treatment made him sulky.</p>

<p>"Don't get mad," said Ralph kindly; "you know
designing is hard work and the only way you can
learn is to have me help you by pointing out your
weak spots. Artists are obliged to pay for criticism;
you know I'm not finding fault."</p>

<p>"All right," said Harry, brightening up, "which
one shall I make?"</p>

<p>"I think the one marked <i>x</i> is the best. Work
it up more carefully, design the shelf and bracket
and put on all the dimensions."</p>

<p>"The bracket? Why, what is this I have drawn?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>"That's the back piece that goes against the
wall; the bracket piece supports the shelf, and
remember when you make it in wood, the grain
must always run the long way of each piece."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you," said Ralph.</p>

<p>He cut out two pieces of wood about 8 &times; 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches, one with the grain running lengthwise and
on the other the grain running the one-inch way.
Handing the first piece to Harry, he said, "Let me
see you break it with your hands."</p>

<p>The boy tried and failed. Handing him the
second piece he said, "Now try this."</p>

<p>It broke so readily that Harry was astonished.</p>

<p>"That's why," said Ralph, "and that's all."</p>

<p>The three pieces as finally drawn are shown in
<a href="#fig151">Fig. 151</a> at <i>x</i>. They were all cut out of gum wood
with a coping saw, finished to the lines with chisel,
spokeshave and sand-paper block, and put together
with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads. The nails were driven through
the back into the bracket, the latter piece being held
in the vise in a horizontal position. It was then
shifted to a vertical position with the back piece
to the left of the vise and the shelf nailed to the
bracket. Two brads were also driven through the
back into the shelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>Brackets may be ornamented in many ways;
by chip carving, pyrography, or by staining, but
the decoration should be put on before assembling.</p>

<p>Another form is shown at <i>b</i> in which the back
piece is not carried above the shelf, the latter piece
resting on the top of the back. From a constructive
standpoint this is a stronger form than the
other, as part of the weight is carried by the back
instead of by the brads alone.</p>

<p>Corner brackets are sometimes used and may
be made in the form shown at <i>c</i>. Here we have two
wall pieces and a V-shaped shelf, the V being a
right angle. Again, the form may be so long as
to require two brackets and it may then be considered
a shelf.</p>

<p>In fastening any of these forms to a plastered
wall, considerable care must be taken in placing the
nails or screws so that they will engage in a stud
instead of just in the plaster. The location of the
studs can be found by tapping on the wall with the
knuckle or lightly with a hammer. A surer way,
however, is to find the nails in the picture moulding
or base board and plumb from either of these places
with a small weight&mdash;such as a nail&mdash;on a string.</p>

<p>The designing and making of book racks offer
an almost endless field for the imagination. The
rac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>k may have a fixed length or be adjustable and
either of these forms may have fixed or folding
ends, and again the shapes of the ends may be varied
in form and decorated in several ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig152"></a><img src="images/fig152.jpg" width="600" height="473" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 152. Types of book racks</div>

</div>

<p>Perhaps one of the simplest forms of folding book
rack is shown in <a href="#fig152">Fig. 152</a>, at <i>a</i>. The ends are sawed
out of the bottom piece, pivoted with two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
dowels and when stood upright the lower part
strikes against a cleat, which acts as a rest for the
rack and a stop for the end piece.</p>

<p>The weakness of most book racks lies in the gradual
weakening of the ends at the joint so that the weight
of the books makes them lean outward. This should
be considered carefully in working up the design.
One of the weakest forms perhaps is shown at <i>b</i>.
Theoretically, this is all right, but in practice the
ends soon bend or lean out. A skeleton form, making
use of the halved joint, is shown at <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>The two long sides and two short ends are squared
up and halved as shown. All the ends are bevelled.
Holes are bored for the pivots&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch dowels&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>distance from the cross pieces equal to half the
thickness of the folding ends. This is to insure
the ends standing perfectly upright against cross
pieces. If this distance is greater than half the
thickness, the ends will lean out, and if less than half,
the ends cannot be gotten in place. The bottom of
the ends must be rounded, or they will not fold over.</p>

<p>The construction is very simple, and requires
little material. Another very ordinary method is
shown at <i>d</i>. It is as common and simple as it is
weak and unsatisfactory. The ends are placed
on the bottom piece and hinged. If a cheap and
quick method is desired, it would be better to place
the hinges as shown at <i>e</i>, because then the tendency
to tilt out is prevented by the pressure against the
bottom piece as long as the screws hold.</p>

<p>A far better method is to mortise the shelf through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>the end pieces and fasten it with a good, healthy
pin or wedge, as shown at <i>f</i>; and a still better plan is
to have two mortises and two wedges, as shown at <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>In constructive design, nothing is lost by honesty.
The ends in this case are held in place by pins,
so instead of hiding the fact, emphasize it by making
these pins big and strong enough to do their work.
The rack may be further strengthened by adding
corner brackets at <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>Having decided on the construction, the form of
the ends may be taken up. This is affected somewhat
by the construction, but some of the outlines
tried by our boys and suggestive to other boys are
shown at 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p>They used two distinct kinds. One was characterized
by straight lines. These they decorated
with chip carving. The other style was distinguished
by curved outlines, and decorated by outlines
made with the veining tool, and by staining the
figures in various colours.</p>

<p>The stains they used were oil colours thinned with
turpentine so as to bring out the grain of the wood,
rather than to hide it, as in painting, and care was
taken to tone down these colours to dull reds, browns,
greens, and grays. For staining and polishing,
turn to <a href="#XLIX">Chapter XLIX</a>.</p>

<small>CONSTRUCTION</small></h2>

<div class="caption">Fig. 153</div>
</div>

<p>The study of construction includes
many items such as
strength, proportion, joints,
etc. If we look at the roof timbers shown in outline
at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig153">Fig. 153</a>), the interesting parts of the
construction are the three spaces enclosed by circles.
The straight lines between these circles do not
interest us very much, but the parts enclosed do.
Immediately the question arises, how are the timbers
fastened at these places? In other words, what
kind of joint is used? The joint then is the critical
part, or we might say the cream of the
construction.</p>

<p>A very large number of joints are in use, but
many of them are rare. Our grandfathers, who
built their houses and barns from oak timbers
hewn out with the axe, commonly used the mortise
and tenon, fastened with a generous hard wood
pin, and many of them are still standing after a
century or two of hard usage. The fact that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>beams were rough hewn, instead of sawed, did not
in any way affect their strength, because they made
good, strong joints.</p>

<p>Some of the more common joints are shown in the
accompanying illustrations, and may be used for
reference.</p>

<p>No. 1. A butt joint in which the two pieces
are fastened together, end to end, by means of glue
and dowels. It should be used only in cases where
there is little strain in the direction of the two pieces.</p>

<p>No. 2. A dowel joint joining two pieces at right
angles. One form of it is shown at No. 3 applied
to the leg of a table.</p>

<p>No. 4. Shows two pieces fastened edge to edge
by dowels. This joint is often made without the
dowels; the two strips, after jointing or fitting,
being glued and rubbed together&mdash;sometimes called
a rubbed joint.</p>

<p>No. 5. A butt joint fastened by nails, brads, or
screws, common in box construction.</p>

<p>No. 6. A butt joint where the pieces are not at
right angles, owing to the slant. This is called
the hopper joint and it is fastened with nails or
brads.</p>

<p>No. 7. End lap. A joint much used in house
framing.

pieces lengthwise. It needs to be nailed or bolted
to prevent pulling apart.</p>

<p>No. 9. A middle lap joint.</p>

<p>No. 10. Dovetail lap or lap dovetail. This
form resists pulling apart and is a combination
of lap and dovetail joints.</p>

<p>No. 11. Shows a modification of the same, only
one side being dovetailed.

<div class="caption">Fig. 154b. Joints used in construction (continued)</div>

</div>

<p>No. 12. Halved joint. Both pieces are cut out
to half their thickness, and a width equal to that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>the other piece. The pieces may be at right angles
or some other angle, as shown at No. 13.</p>

<p>No. 13. Halved joint at 45 degrees.</p>

<p>No. 14. Lock joint. This is a form of lap joint
rarely used. It resists pulling apart, but should
be glued on account of shrinkage.</p>

<p>No. 15. Notched joint; used where two pieces
cross, and where full halving is not desirable, as in
the sketch of pergola.</p>

<p>No. 16. Rabbeted or gained joint.</p>

<p>No. 17. Dado joint.</p>

<p>No. 18. Gained or housed joint.</p>

<p>No. 19. Through mortise and tenon, used in
furniture construction and building.</p>

<p>
Note&mdash;16, 17, 18 are often confused, and are named differently by mechanics.
They are used in boxes, and cabinet work.</p>

<p>No. 20. Blind mortise and tenon, same as No.
19, except that the tenon does not go through and
is invisible. These two joints may be fastened
with glue, and are often strengthened by passing
a dowel through at right angles to the tenon.
Another method is to make two or more saw cuts
in the tenon, and drive wedges into the cuts.</p>

<p>In door construction, where the rails meet the
stiles, the tenon is often divided, as shown by the
dotted line. The two parts fitted into separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>mortises give the appearance of two distinct tenons
on the edge of the door.</p>

<p>No. 21. Relished mortise and tenon or door
joint, a form used at the corners of doors.</p>

<p>No. 22. End mortise and tenon. The tenon is
seen on two sides. Used for frames of various kinds.</p>

<p>No. 23. The mitre joint, used in picture frames,
picture moulding, interior finish of houses, etc.</p>

<p>No. 24. Lap mitre joint; a combination of
end lap and mitre; rarely used.</p>

<p>No. 25. Stretcher joint; a combination of end
lap, mitre, and end mortise and tenon; used by
artists for frames on which their canvas is fastened.
The stretching is done by driving wedges from the
inside.</p>

<p>No. 26. Dovetail; used as a splice.</p>

<p>No. 27. Single open dovetail for two pieces at
right angles. When two or more are cut in the
same place, we have the open or box dovetail.</p>

<p>No. 28. Box dovetail; used in cabinet work
and boxes.</p>

<p>No. 29. Half-blind dovetail. The dovetails are
seen from only one side; used in cabinet work,
especially in drawer construction.</p>

<p>No. 30. Blind dovetail. When the two pieces
are together, the dovetails are invisible. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>joint calls for very accurate work. It is used in
special cases, where strength is required, and yet
it is desirable to hide the form of construction.</p>

<p>No. 31. Trick dovetail; not used in construction,
and only of interest as a curiosity. The four sides
of this trick combination are apparently exactly
alike. It seems impossible for them to have been
put together, and to bring out the effect it is well
to have one piece in light-coloured wood, the other
dark. The method of laying out and cutting is
shown in the illustration. The dovetails that appear
on the surface are only oblique sections of dovetailed-shaped
tongues and grooves running diagonally
from face to face.</p>

<p>No. 32. Another trick. This at first sight appears
like a lap dovetail, but the end view shows
another dovetail, making it apparently impossible
to put together. The construction is shown clearly
in the drawing. It is of no value in constructive work.</p>

<p>No. 33. Splice or scarf joint; used in framing,
occasionally; of little value to boys.</p>

<p>No. 34. Tongue and groove joint; used in flooring
and for sheathing.</p>

<p>Scores of other joints might be shown, but they
are seldom used, and are of no value to amateur
mechanics.</p>

<br />
<small>THE USE OF THE GOUGE</small></h2>


<p>"There is one tool you have not learned to
use," said Ralph, one day, "and I think
that it is about time you tried it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a id="fig155"></a><img src="images/fig155.jpg" width="150" height="583" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 155. The gouge</div>

</div>

<p>"What tool is that?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"The gouge ground or bevelled on the
outside." (<a href="#fig155">Fig. 155</a>.)</p>

<p>"What is it used for?"</p>

<p>"For cutting concave curves, especially
those below the surface. Suppose you
practise on a piece of white wood."</p>

<p>A piece of white wood was squared up, a
foot long and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches square. The lines
shown in the figure were laid out with the
pencil. The marking gauge is not suitable
for this work, as it makes a sharp cut in
the surface just where the edge is to come,
so that after the gouge work is finished,
it would show this edge split by the gauge mark.
(<a href="#fig156">Fig. 156</a>.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig156"></a><img src="images/fig156.jpg" width="300" height="97" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 156. Practise cuts with the gouge</div>

</div>

<p>The two grooves from end to end were first cut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>removing a quarter circle, the curve being drawn
on the ends by a pair of compasses or dividers.
This gave excellent
practice in freehand
work, calling for good
control over the hands,
and a constant watching of the grain to prevent
splitting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig157"></a><img src="images/fig157.jpg" width="600" height="246" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 157. An example of gouge work</div>

</div>

<p>The other two grooves or coves were next tried.
Extra care had to be exercised here to prevent taking
off the ends.</p>

<p>To give the boy further practice, the simple pen
tray shown in <a href="#fig157">Fig. 157</a> was sketched out, and the
stock squared up.</p>

<p>The gouge work in this exercise was entirely beneath
the surface, and to make the tool work true
to the drawing, a depth gauge was made as shown
at <i>a</i>. This was simply a straight piece of waste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>wood with a brad driven into it, carefully, until the
head was the same distance above the surface as
the depth of the groove called for in the drawing.</p>

<p>By inverting the gauge and running the brad
head along the bottom of the groove, the depth
could be gauged accurately. The wooden strip
must rest on the surface at both sides of the groove,
and the brad head just touches the bottom at the
same time.</p>

<p>After the gouge work had been carried as far as
possible, the groove was finished by sand-papering,
first with No. 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  and then with No. 0 sand-paper.</p>

<p>In laying out bevelled edges on a piece of this
character, the same objection to the marking gauge
holds as for gouged grooves. Ralph showed the
boy a simple method of making a gauge for pencil
lines to overcome this difficulty. He cut out a
piece of white pine shaped as shown at <i>b</i>. The
distance from the shoulder to the point of the V
was equal to the width of the desired bevel or
chamfer. The stock must be held in the vise, as
both hands are required in the drawing of the lines.
To make the width of the bevel greater, simply cut
the shoulder further back with a knife, and to reduce
the size, cut the V further in toward the shoulder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>This is a very convenient and inexpensive device,
quickly made.</p>

<p>A more pretentious project was tried next (<a href="#fig158">Fig.
158</a>, <i>a</i>), which provides for a round ink bottle,
and demands some nice chisel work. In the first
pen tray the bevels had been all planed. On
this second one, only three could be cut that way,
as the one on the back had to be chiselled. The
successive steps in the construction were as follows:</p>

<p>1. Square up stock.</p>

<p>2. Lay out the drawing on the wood.</p>

<p>3. Bore the hole for ink well half way through
the wood with extension bit.</p>

<p>4. Smooth the bottom of the hole with chisel,
holding it bevel down.</p>

<p>5. Gouge out the groove and gauge the depth.</p>

<p>6. Sand-paper the groove.</p>

<p>7. Cut out the outline of the back with the back
saw and chisel.</p>

<p>8. Cut all the bevels, doing the back part&mdash;the
most difficult&mdash;first.</p>

<p>9. Draw chip carving design.</p>

<p>10. Do the carving.</p>

<p>11. Rub down with wax dissolved in turpentine.</p>

<p>12. Insert ink well.</p>

<p>Design No. 3, shown at <i>b</i> (<a href="#fig158">Fig. 158</a>), called for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>molded edges, places for two square ink wells, and
a simple carved design in the flat space between
them. The process in this case was as follows:</p>

<p>1. Square up.</p>

<p>2. Lay out the work from drawing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>3. Cut out squares <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch deep with socket
chisel and mallet.</p>

<p>4. Gouge groove.</p>

<p>5. Make moulded edges by first gouging the
quarter circle shown in detail drawing, and doing
the long sides with the grain first. Next remove
the rest of the wood outside the curved outline with
smoothing plane on long sides, block plane on ends.
Sand-paper the groove and moulded edges.</p>

<p>6. Lay out and execute carving.</p>

<p>7. Rub down with wax or raw linseed oil.</p>

<p>8. Insert ink wells.</p>

</div>

<p>In place of carving this inkstand, an inlaid
design could have been used, and the whole piece
highly polished, but our boy had not yet had any
practice in inlaying or polishing, so he used sweet
gum wood and a chip carving design. Later on
he made others out of black walnut and mahogany,
and gave them a high polish. See <a href="#XXXVI">Chapter XXXVI</a>
for inlaying and <a href="#XLIX">XLIX</a> for polishing.</p>

<p>A very nice little problem in gouge work is shown
in <a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>, a pen tray pure and simple, with no
provision for ink wells.</p>

<p>The only new feature is the under cutting of the
outside. The steps for this are:</p>

<p>1. Square up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>2. Lay out from a centre line, drawn completely
around the block lengthwise, and draw with compasses

<p>Perhaps the most severe test for gouge work is
the pin tray shown at <a href="#fig160">Fig. 160</a>. This is something
which could be made more cheaply and in less time
from metal, but a skilful and careful boy can do it
successfully in a hard wood, such as maple. The
process is similar to the pen tray. The drawing
is laid out on the squared stock, and the bowl cut
out with the gouge.</p>

<p>The outside is best executed with a template,
or better, two&mdash;one for the lengthwise section
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>and one for the width. A template is a form cut
out of thin wood or metal; in this case <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch wood
should be used. By frequently holding these templates
to the work, it may be quickly seen where
the material is to be removed.</p>

<p>When the outside of the tray fits the templates,
it is ready for sand-papering, and not before. To
make the tray perfect, an inside template can be
used. This template method is used in forming
boat models.</p>

<small>COAT HANGER AND TOWEL ROLLERS</small></h2>


<p>The coat hanger is a convenient thing in
every household, and also a good example
of spokeshave work.</p>

<p>A soft wood, like pine, or white wood, is suitable,
and after squaring up two faces and one edge, the
design may be drawn on one or both of the faces
with a sharp pencil. Cut close to the lines with a
turning saw, and finish to lines with spokeshave.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="fig161"></a><img src="images/fig161.jpg" width="500" height="208" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 161. The coat hanger</div>

</div>

<p>The upper edge is next rounded with the spokeshave
(<a href="#fig161">Fig. 161</a>), and finished with sand-paper to the
cross section shown in the drawing. Bore a hole for
the hook with a gimlet bit, and make the hook from
strong brass wire, shaped by bending with a pair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>pliers. For finishing, two coats of shellac can be
used. The first coat after hardening is sand-papered
flat with No. 00 sand-paper; the second may be
treated in the same way, or rubbed down with ground
pumice stone and linseed oil. (See <a href="#XLIX">polishing chapter</a>.)</p>

<p>For the kitchen, the towel roller is still used to
some extent, especially in the country and suburbs.
It consists of four pieces, a back, two brackets, and
the roller. These essential parts are shown in
<a href="#fig162">Fig. 162</a> and the back and brackets may be modified
and improved as shown at <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Carving can be used in a simple form on the ends,
as shown at <i>c</i>. The back and ends are cut out with
the usual tools, but it is wise, in cutting the outline
of the ends, to glue them together with a piece of
paper between, cutting both at the same time. This
insures their being exactly alike, and when finished
they may be easily separated by inserting the blade
of a knife between them. The paper will split,
half coming off on each piece.</p>

<p>After the paper and glue have been planed off,
a hole is bored half way through each end from
the inside. On one end it is necessary to cut a
groove of the same width and depth as the hole,
clear up to the top, so that the roller can be inserted
after assembling, and a towel be put over it. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>ends are fastened with two flat-head screws
each, by boring through the back, and countersinking.</p>

<p>Two holes should also be bored through the back
for fastening it to the wall.</p>

<p>The roller may be turned on a lathe or made at
the bench by the following method:</p>

<p>1. Square up the stock to the diameter of the
roller called for in the drawing.</p>

<p>2. Find the exact centre of each end by drawing
the diagonals with a pencil.</p>

<p>3. Draw a circle on each end from these centres
of full diameter.</p>

<p>4. Bore a hole at each of these centres <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
diameter, and about an inch deep.</p>

<p>5. Plane off the four corners down to the circle
to produce an octagonal form.</p>

<p>6. Plane off the eight corners, using as a stop
a small piece of wood fastened in the vise. Hold
the roller against this stop, and allow the stock to
rest over the open space in the vise. Continue
to plane off the edges as long as they are large enough
to see or feel.</p>

<p>7. Sand-paper with coarse, followed by fine, sand-paper.</p>

<p>8. Glue into the holes in the ends pieces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>dowel long enough to project out about half an
inch.</p>

<p>9. Allow the glue to harden over night, and saw
off the dowels next day to the proper length. Cut
a slight bevel on the end of each dowel with the
knife.</p>

<p>If any carving is to be done on the ends, it must
be cut before they are screwed to the back piece.</p>

</div>

<p>This method of producing a cylinder without
a turning lathe can be used in a number of ways.
For example, boys living in the city, where a pull-up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>bar has to be located in the house, can easily make
one in this way, and fasten it between the door
jambs at a convenient height.</p>

<p>The blocks for supporting it can be made, as
shown in <a href="#fig163">Fig. 163</a>, three inches each way and
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch thick. Oak is the best wood for this purpose.
It is strong enough, and can be stained to match the
door frame.</p>

<p>Bore and countersink four holes for 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch flat-head
screws.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig163"></a><img src="images/fig163.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 163. The pull-up bar</div>
</div>

<p>To prevent the bar turning, after it has been
planed round and
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch shorter
than the space between
the jambs, lay
out a one-inch square
on each end. Cut
out with a back saw,
and chisel until it just
fits the square opening in the blocks. This bar
can be taken out and stored in a closet, when not
in use, and the blocks will never be in the way.</p>

<p>If the bar is so loose in the blocks that it has a
tendency to spring out when you jump for it, a flat
piece of oak can be screwed across the top, as shown
in the illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>This is an excellent, if limited, gymnasium for
those who get little exercise and whose time and
space are limited. Every boy ought to be able to
"chin the bar" at least six or seven times without
letting go.</p>

<p>Round objects with a taper, such as pointers and
musicians' batons, can be made by this method,
always getting the taper in the square form first,
then planing off corners, etc. It is really work
for a turning lathe, but one must work with such
tools as he can afford to purchase.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 165. The hammer handle</div>

</div>

<p>Many useful articles of oval or elliptical cross
section can be made at a bench which could not
be made on an ordinary lathe. The hatchet handle
shown in <a href="#fig164">Fig. 164</a> is a good example. The wood
used should be strong and tough, such as hickory
or maple. After squaring up the stock to the over all
dimensions, the
outline is drawn on
both flat faces, and
sawed close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>lines with turning saw, finished with drawing knife
and spokeshave. The oval or elliptical forms are
then drawn on the ends, the corners rounded with
spokeshave to these curves, and the whole finished
with sand-paper.</p>

<p>The hammer handle (<a href="#fig165">Fig. 165</a>) is made in the same
manner.</p>

<p>The woodworkers of Northern Europe make many
household utensils in this way. The sugar scoop
and the wooden ladle, shown in <a href="#fig166">Figs. 166</a> and <a href="#fig166a">166 <i>a</i></a>,
are familiar examples. In these two cases, the bowl
is work for the gouge, while in rounding, some of the
surfaces are done with the file. On general principles,
it is not wise to get into the habit of using a file on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>wood, except in rare cases where the material is very
hard, such as maple, beech, and similar woods.</p>

<p>The back piece is made with plane and chisel.
The straight bevels are cut with the smoothing
plane, and the curves with the chisel. The two
openings or mortises should be laid out and cut
before the ends are rounded. The wood is removed
by boring several small holes within the
lines, and finishing to line with a chisel and mallet.
The two supports, or brackets, involve nothing
new, and after being finished are glued into mortises.</p>

<p>The towel sticks may be ten inches or more in
length, squared up to <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch. The taper
begins two inches from the bored end, and from this
point is planed in a straight line to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>at the small end. The rounding is done in the same
manner as in the towel roller, the tips rounded
with a knife, and the whole piece sand-papered
smooth.</p>

<p>The three sticks are held between the two supports
and a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch dowel passed through the five holes,
which should of course be in line.</p>

<p>The ends of this dowel can be split before they
are placed, and then in the final position small thin
wedges can be driven in with a little glue.</p>

<br />
<small>CLOCK CASES</small></h2>


<p>Among small articles for household use the
clock case is a popular model, and the designs
range from the mission style, characterized
by straight lines and plain surfaces, up to
elaborate attempts at imitating in miniature the
old-fashioned tall "grandfather's clock."</p>

<p>While an ordinary alarm clock may be used for
the clock proper, the small size nickeled clock, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches outside diameter, is more satisfactory and
very reliable. It costs about seventy-five cents.</p>

<p>In designing the frame, or case, structural items
must be considered first. The clock needs a platform
to stand on, there must be a circular opening
just large enough for the face to fit, and the structure
requires an opening in the back, so that the clock
may be wound or removed.</p>

<p>With these facts as a basis, the form can be
sketched out.</p>

<p><a href="#fig168">Fig. 168</a> shows, perhaps, the simplest style, on the
mission order. The design of the front becomes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>matter of proportion, and the dimensions given are
only suggestions which the young designer can
modify to meet his own ideas, keeping in mind that
on horizontal members, if there is any difference in
size, the upper ones should be the smaller.</p>

<p>Simple as this design appears, if put together by
mortise and tenon, with provision made for the
panelled front and sides, it will call for fine work.
As there is no great question of strength involved,
the following method will do for making this case.
It will be called heretical by expert woodworkers,
but is practicable and easy from the boy's point
of view.</p>

<p>Square up a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch stock 4 inches wide
and 13 inches long. Saw out two pieces for the
panels 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long.</p>

<p>Clamp the front piece to a strip of scrap wood
as a backing, and bore a hole for the clock face with
an expansive bit. Fasten the front to the end pieces
by <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads, as shown in <i>a</i>. In the same manner
nail the top and bottom pieces to the front and
ends, making a box of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch wood, with the back
open.</p>

<p>The legs, made <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch square with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
rabbet cut out as shown at <i>a</i>, may now be glued on
and fastened with two 1-inch brads driven in from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>the ends. The horizontal rails are cut and fitted
to the front and ends and glued in position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig168"></a><img src="images/fig168.jpg" width="600" height="559" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 168. Mission style clock case</div>

</div>

<p>If brads are used, they must be set, and the holes
filled with putty, coloured to correspond with the
wood used. If the legs of the clock are too short
to rest on the bottom, add a
shelf, or glue on a block of pine
thick enough to bring the clock to the proper level.</p>

<p>If the case is made of hard wood, polish it to a
dead flat finish. This design, however, gives a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>splendid opportunity to ornament ends and front with
chip carving, for which gum wood will be suitable.</p>

<p>A clock case which can be easily upset is to be
avoided, and therefore these long low designs are
to be recommended, when the clock is to stand on a
mantel, shelf, or bureau. If the clock is to hang
on the wall the designs immediately change. The
cuckoo clock is a familiar example.</p>

<p>Our boys wrestled with the problem of a wall
clock, and their efforts to create something new
brought forth considerable mental perspiration.
It is always an easy matter to copy something one
has seen, but that is not designing.</p>

<p>The result of Harry's efforts is shown in <a href="#fig169">Fig. 169</a>.
After drawing the circles with a pair of compasses,
the rest of the figure was sketched out free-hand
about a centre line.</p>

<p>When it was fairly satisfactory, the two sides
of the lower half were equalized and traced for the
upper half. It was then measured, and the main
dimensions added to the drawing.</p>

<p>This drawing represented only the front. The
back, or wall piece, had to be a duplicate of it as
far as outline was concerned, and a plain box of
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch wood, to hold the clock, joined these two
parts, as in previous models.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig169"></a><img src="images/fig169.jpg" width="400" height="637" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 169. The boys' first design for a clock case</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>This is the order of construction:</p>

<p>Saw out stock for front and back pieces 15 &times; 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
&times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches. Draw two centre lines, one the 4-inch
way, the other the 15-inch way. At the point
where they cross, bore the hole for the clock face,
after drawing all the circles
with the compasses.</p>

<p>Draw outline, or trace it
from original drawing, upon
the surface of the wood.
Saw out close to outside lines,
and finish to lines with
spokeshave, chisel and
sand-paper block.</p>

<p>Bevel the clock opening
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch with knife, and
smooth with sand-paper.
The curved lines inside of
the outer edge are worked
out with a veining tool.</p>

<p>The back piece is made in
the same way, but the central
opening is bored larger
than the front one, to allow the clock to be withdrawn
or wound. The square box, joined to these
two main pieces by means of cleats, completes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>structure. On account of the long overhang of the
front beyond the box, two cylindrical supports of
the same material as the
case can be glued between
front and back, to add
strength.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig170"></a><img src="images/fig170.jpg" width="400" height="986" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 170. Pendulum form of clock case</div>

</div>

<p>Owing to the symmetry
of the design, this case
can be hung horizontally
or vertically according to
the wall space it is to
occupy. The method of
fastening should be a
screw eye at the top of
the case and screw hook
or nail in the wall, as
it will be necessary to
remove the clock each
time it is wound. If
placed horizontally two
hooks and eyes will be
needed, one at each end.
<a href="#fig170">Fig. 170</a> shows another
wall design in which the
clock forms the centre of
the pendulum and rests in a box of hexagon shape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>This is made from a strip two inches wide,
the pieces cut on a 60-degree mitre box with
back saw, each piece 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches long on the
short side.</p>

<p>It will just hold a clock 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches in its largest
diameter. When the face of this clock frame is
bored, and the outline finished in the usual
way, it is fastened to the hexagonal box by
cleats.</p>

<p>In order to do this accurately, turn the face
upside down on the bench, place the box in position,
and mark with a pencil all around the hexagon.
The cleats must be fastened on the back, close up
to the pencil line, with glue and brads, so carefully
that the brads shall not be long enough to come
through to the surface in front. When dry, insert
the box between the cleats, and make fast with glue
and brads. The long part of the pendulum can be
either carved or polished plain. The <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch hole
bored in the upper part fits over a screw hook, which
should project at least an inch from the wall. To
have the clock hang perfectly plumb, this hook
should project 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches.</p>

<p>Another form of mantel clock is suggested in
<a href="#fig171">Fig. 171</a>. It is radically different from the others,
and is characterized by a long, low, and massive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>base cut from a solid piece of wood 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches thick
or built up of two <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch pieces of red gum, black
walnut, or mahogany. The outline having been
drawn on the planed surface, one must saw as close
to the line as possible, and finish the line with chisel,
gouge, file, and sand-paper. The circular piece,
which is to enclose the clock, is cut from a block of
the same material, two inches thick. Draw the two
circles, and bore the inner one with an extension
bit, unless a turning lathe is available. In that case
the circular block can be turned with great accuracy.
The outline can be cut with the chisel after being
sawed close to the line, and finished in the same
way as the base.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 171. Mantel clock</div>

</div>

<p>Glue this block in position, resting it in the
semicircular opening provided in the base, and
making it project <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  of an inch beyond the
front surface of the base. Polish to a dead, flat
finish.</p>

<p>As the clock is to fit snugly into the opening, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>legs, and the handle at the top, must be
removed.</p>


<h3>THE GRANDFATHERS' CLOCK</h3>

<p>One of the most interesting problems in clock
case designing is a miniature of the tall clock of
colonial times, commonly known as the grandfathers'
clock. It is a simple and satisfactory
form, but it is very important to have good proportions.</p>

<p>The dimensions used by our boys are given in the
drawing. (<a href="#fig172">Fig. 172</a>). As in all the other designs, it
is based or built up around the ordinary nickel-plated
clock, whose outside diameter is 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches.
With a circle of this diameter as a starter, the other
sizes work out as given in the drawing.</p>

<p>About the only fault likely to be found with this
form is top heaviness, as the clock is some fifteen
inches above its base. This can be counteracted
by boring a hole in the back, two or three inches
above the bottom, and pouring in about a pound
of shot or other heavy material.</p>

<p>The method of construction is as follows:</p>

<p>All the material is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch thick, except the base
and mouldings, which require <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch wood. Red gum
is very satisfactory, but more expensive woods,
such as mahogany, can be used, especially if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>front panel, which in full-sized clocks is a door, is
to be inlaid.</p>

<p>If gum wood is used, this panel can be decorated
with chip carving or simply outlined with a veining
tool. If an especially elaborate result is desired,
it can be accomplished by a raised panel with
moulded edges made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch wood, fastened to
the front with glue and small brads.</p>

<p>After getting out the material construct the long
box which makes the body of the design. This will
be 17<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long, 3 inches wide by 2 inches deep,
and the method of putting together is shown at <i>a</i>.
This allows only one joint to show on each side,
and the back piece may be of cheap material, such
as white wood.</p>

<p>The smallest partition, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> , of white
wood, is inserted in the bottom, pushed up <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch,
and fastened with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads from the outside.
This size of brad will not split <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch gum wood,
unless driven in nearer the edge than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig172"></a><img src="images/fig172.jpg" width="600" height="804" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 172. Grandfathers' clock</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>One of the remaining partitions is placed in the
upper end, as in a box, one edge flush with the back.
The entire back of the case must be in a straight
line. The end just inserted will project out in
front a quarter of an inch. Place the remaining
partition 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches down from the extreme top
of the box. This will bring it to rest against the
front, which is only 14<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches high.</p>

<p>The compartment for holding the clock is now
complete, open front and back.</p>

<p>The base may next be prepared, taking care to
have the grain running up and down. The front
piece of the base is 4 &times; 4 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches. Side pieces
of base are 4 &times; 2 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> . These three pieces are to
be put together with a butt joint, as shown in the
bottom view, and fastened with one-inch brads and
a little glue. Four <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads can be used on
each of the three sides to hold the base to the box.
It is very important that the bottom be perfectly
square. It should be tested and, if necessary,
squared with a block plane.</p>

<p>The cove moulding for upper and lower parts
may now be prepared. Square up one piece of
stock 18 inches or 20 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches square. Draw
a quarter circle with a radius of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch on each
end, and remove the wood in this space with a gouge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>Finish with sand-paper. This moulding is fitted
around the three sides at top of base with a back
saw and mitre box. Put it in place with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
brads and glue, and carefully remove any trace of
glue that may appear, before it hardens.</p>

<p>The moulding for the upper part cannot be placed
until the top is finished.</p>

<p>After squaring up the face, draw the outline
directly on the wood. The curves at the top should
be first laid out carefully on stiff paper, cut out with
scissors, and traced on the wood.</p>

<p>The opening for the clock, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches diameter,
must be bored first. Either a sharp centre bit or
an extension bit should be used. If the latter,
an <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch hole must be bored at the centre, otherwise
the tapering spur of the extension bit will
surely split the thin wood. This is the most delicate
operation in the whole process, and the circular
opening will need smoothing with a sand-paper
block.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in getting a satisfactory opening,
the outline is sawed close to the lines with
a coping saw and finished with sand-paper.</p>

<p>The supplementary pieces <i>s s</i>, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches, are next fastened to the sides at the top.
They are flush with the top of the box and with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>bottom of the face piece just described. It is to
these that the front is mainly fastened. Test the
bottom edges of these pieces across both the front
and back with a try square. Fasten the front to
these and to the top of the box with brads, and add
the moulding, as shown in drawing. If the front
panel is to be carved, that should be done before
either the base or the top is put on; and if it is to
be inlaid, the front should be increased in thickness
to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches, reducing the sides to 1<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches
in place of 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches.</p>

<p>After the assembling is finished, set all the brads,
and fill the holes with putty, coloured to match the
wood. Either an oil or wax finish can be used, but
a high polish is not advisable. All lines on the
front, which are not edges, can be cut with a veining
tool.</p>

<p>Several modifications of this method can be
adopted. The front panel may be made a real
door, put on with small ornamental hinges. This
will increase the work, make it more realistic, but
result in little real gain.</p>

<p>The door in large clocks was necessary for getting
at the weights and pendulum, but as these parts
are missing in our model, the door is not necessary,
except possibly for hiding things from burglars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>It is the last spot they would be likely to think of
as a hiding place for treasures.</p>

<p>As in previous designs, the ring at the top of
the clock can be removed, if it prevents fitting into
the opening provided.</p>

<p>The drawing shows a curve in the front of the
base. It is not essential, but may be cut at any
convenient stage of the construction with the coping
saw, and sand-papered.</p>

<p>By comparing this design with some real old six-foot
clocks, the young designer will see that we have
taken some liberties for the purpose of simplifying
the work. Highly ornamental tops were sometimes
used, with metal and carved ornaments. It is
never difficult to make elaborate designs, and the
young woodworker can go as far as he likes in that
direction. It is, however, sometimes difficult to
simplify designs, and this we believe is at present
highly desirable.</p>

<small>FOOTSTOOLS</small></h2>


<p>The making of household furniture is a fascinating
employment, and as there are varying
styles and fashions in nearly all things
which pertain to our homes, it will always be an
interesting study. The savage knows nothing of
furniture, for the ground is his chair, bed, and table.
As we go up in the scale of civilization, we find the
characteristics of a people reflected in the details
of their home life.</p>

<p>In Japan, the house and its equipment are characterized
by directness, simplicity, and subtle beauty.</p>

<p>In America, we find a bewildering display of
ever-changing devices, styles, forms, and schemes
of decoration, in keeping with our rapidly changing
and, we believe, rapidly improving taste in the
intimate things of life.</p>

<p>This condition is reflected in our furniture as
much as in our clothes and in the pictures we buy.
The black walnut furniture, with its hard horsehair
upholstering, has been followed by antique oak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>fumed oak, golden oak, forest green oak, mahogany,
bird's-eye maple, French walnut, etc., and in a very
few years we shall probably be using some of the
beautiful but almost unknown woods of the Philippines,
because fashions in woods are very materially
affected by the lumber supply.</p>

<p>Gilt chairs&mdash;not made to sit on&mdash;have been
followed by the more sensible mission style, bringing
a much needed simplicity, directness, and strength,
together with an unfortunate addition of weight for
the housewife to move around when cleaning.
There seems to be no great gain without some loss.
Modern office furniture, with its simple and strong
chairs, tables, and desks, can hardly be improved
upon, and it is almost a pity that some of these
excellencies cannot be introduced into the home,
which is often overloaded, overdecorated, and encumbered
with unnecessary articles.</p>

<p>Miss Louise Brigham gives us a fragrant breath
of fresh air along this line in her interesting book
on furniture made from boxes. What is needed is
clear thinking. Never design nor make a piece of
furniture without asking, "What is this to be used
for? What will be required of it?" etc.</p>

<p>This is the gist of what Ralph said to Harry one
day when they were about to launch out into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>making of footstools, tabourettes and other small
pieces of furniture. Harry would have liked very
much to start with a dining-room table, but Ralph
suggested diplomatically that it might be a good
scheme to try several smaller pieces first.</p>

<p>They decided on a footstool, and this is the catechism
Ralph put Harry through as they worked out
their drawing:</p>

<p>"What is a footstool for?"</p>

<p>"To rest your feet on."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"What else could it be used for?"</p>

<p>"Never answer a question by asking another!
I should say that a footstool might have to stand
hard usage. For instance, suppose you wanted to
reach a shelf high up in a closet. If the stool was
handy, you would probably stand on it. Others
would do the same, and it is easily possible that
somebody weighing over two hundred pounds might
some day stand on it. So I should say, that the
first requisite of a footstool was strength, and the
second that it should not be easily upset.</p>

<p>"When designing furniture, just ask yourself such
questions, and you will find that your designs will
be affected by them. Now I believe that most
footstools are too high and too easily upset."</p>

<a id="fig173"></a><img src="images/fig173.jpg" width="600" height="430" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 173. First foot stool</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
The first design tried is shown in <a href="#fig173">Fig. 173</a>. The
material used was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch chestnut. After squaring
up the top, the two grooves were cut to receive
the upper ends of the legs. For grooves of this
character, after cutting the lines as deep as possible
with the knife, followed by the chisel, the router
may be used. The cutter can be adjusted by means
of the set screw, and a more uniform depth secured
than with the chisel.</p>

<p>There was considerable work on the legs because
of the mortise for the shelf, and the two openings
above. These were cut out close to the line with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>the turning saw after a hole had been bored in each
space, as in scroll saw work.</p>

<p>The outline of the legs was obtained with the same
tool, and finished with the gouge, spokeshave, and
sand-paper. Where hard wood, such as oak, is
used, the wood file may be applied to curved edges.</p>

<p>To overcome the tendency to spread, the legs
were made rigid by cutting the tenons shown on the
drawing of the shelf. In each tenon was cut the
square hole for the wedges. This shelf, when securely
wedged, bound the whole structure rigidly.
When the question of securing the legs to the top
came up, the boys were inclined to use round-head
blue screws from the top, but after considering that
they would be in end grain, it looked as if this would
be the weakest part of the stool. The solution
was an heroic one. Four angle irons were made out
of strap iron taken from a packing case, and cut
with a cold chisel into pieces 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long. Each
had two holes drilled in it to receive the screws, and
was then bent into shape in an iron vise. A monkey
wrench can be used as a vise for work as light as
this. The screws used were <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch long, one fastened
in the top, the other in the leg, for each of
the four angle irons.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 174. Second design for footstool</div>

</div>

<p>Chestnut has a very open grain, and takes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>stain very well. Our boys bought a small can of
paste filler, coloured it with burnt umber, thinned it
with turpentine to the consistency of cream, and
put it on with a brush. The surfaces were rubbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>down with cotton waste, and then it was left over
night, to be ready for polishing in the morning.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 175. Third footstool design</div>

</div>

<p>After this stool was finished, the boys looked it
over critically, and decided that it could be improved
on, that it was
too high and not
heavy enough.</p>

<p>Footstool
number two is
shown in <a href="#fig174">Fig.
174</a>. In this design,
the shelf is
dispensed with,
and two stretchers
or side pieces
substituted;
stock <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch thick took the place of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inch. The two ends were glued together with paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>between, cut out as one piece, afterward separated,
and the paper and glue planed off. The curved outline
was drawn on paper, traced on the wood, sawed
out with turning saw, and finished to line as in previous
work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="fig176"></a><img src="images/fig176.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 176. Fourth footstool design</div>

</div>

<p>The joint for fastening the side piece to the legs
is shown in the drawing. It makes a strong and
rigid combination, calling for a good fit. In putting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>on the top piece, angle irons can be used, but the
boys tried a new method. After gluing the joint,
they bored holes and countersunk them through the
sides, forcing flat-head screws 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches long up
into the top.</p>

<p>Being below the level of the eye, these were
invisible, and they saved the time and labour of making
angle irons. Two screws on each side are enough
to make a solid piece of work. The material was
quartered oak with antique finish. To produce this
effect, lampblack dissolved in turpentine was added
to the filler, and after drying was polished to a dead
flat finish. (See <a href="#XLIX">polishing chapter</a>.)</p>

<p>Design number three is shown in <a href="#fig175">Fig. 175</a>. The
legs run the long way of the stool; joints the same
as number two; top fastened by screws through cross
piece. The height, being much less than in the first
designs, gives it a very massive and substantial
appearance. All eight edges of the top have been
slightly rounded with plane and sand-paper. This
stool is non-upsetable in the direction of its length.
Stand on the extreme end of the top and lean backward;
the stool will not tilt up in the slightest degree.
Harry tried this several times, but it remained on
the floor with all four feet. This does not apply
to the width, so the boys designed number four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>(<a href="#fig176">Fig. 176</a>), which would not upset from the side, where
the feet are usually placed. It is even lower than
number three, and as the other dimensions are
practically the same, it appears even more massive.</p>

<p>The construction is similar to number three, but
the legs are again at the ends, and the whole being
made of oak, or ash, it is practically indestructible.</p>

<p>A very beautiful golden-brown finish may be
given these stools by first coating them with
bichromate of potash.</p>

<p>This chemical comes in crystals, which readily
dissolve in water. Put it on with a one-inch varnish
brush and, when dry, sand-paper down flat with
No. 0 sand-paper. Two or three coats of shellac,
each allowed to harden and dry thoroughly before
being rubbed down with sand-paper, will give a
satisfactory polish. Finish by a rub down with raw
linseed oil, and wipe dry.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIV" id="XXXIV">XXXIV</a><br />
<br />
<small>THE TABOURETTE</small></h2>


<p>This is a favourite problem in woodwork for
boys, because the tabourette can be put
to many uses. It may hold books or magazines,
serve as a pedestal for a jardini&egrave;re, for vases of
flowers, for smokers' sets, etc. Its forms are many,
and the methods of finishing and decorating infinite.</p>

<p>The five styles shown in <a href="#fig177">Figs. 177</a> and <a href="#fig178">178</a> are
perhaps the most common ones, and they are arranged
according to the difficulty of construction.</p>

<p>No. 1. Has a circular top supported by square
legs, bound to a lower shelf.</p>

<p>No 2. Has an octagonal top supported by flat
legs, which are held together by two strips halved
together at the centre, and mortised through the
legs. It is stronger than No. 1.</p>

<p>No 3. Is the familiar hexagonal form, with
only three legs, made rigid by fastening to an
hexagonal shelf.</p>

<p>No. 4. Is the standard square form in mission
style, mortised together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>No 5. One of the simplest in appearance, is
the most difficult to construct, because of the six
long joints mitred at 120 degrees, the well-known
Moorish style.</p>

<p>As it is easily possible for any boy to make any
of these tabourettes with ordinary tools and ordinary
patience, they will be taken up in detail.</p>


<h3>TABOURETTE NUMBER ONE</h3>

<p><i>Stock.</i>&mdash;Four pieces for the legs, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches
square.</p>

<p>The height varies, usually being between fourteen
and eighteen inches. It is purely a matter of proportion.
Sixteen has been adopted in the drawing
as a good average. The top, a circle thirteen inches
in diameter, is cut from a piece thirteen inches square
and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick. The shelf may be an exact duplicate
of the top, but it appears much better, as shown
in the drawing, as a square with corners cut off
to fit against the legs. The method of getting this
form is shown by dotted lines on the circular top.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig177"></a><img src="images/fig177.jpg" width="600" height="916" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 177. Three styles of tabourettes</div>

</div>

<p>The method of construction is very simple. The
top piece being laid out, is cut close to the line with
turning saw, and finished to line with chisel and
spokeshave. The square openings for legs are
sawed out and the wood removed with a chisel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>All chisel work should be done on a bench hook
or on a piece of scrap board, as a cutting block.</p>

<p>In preparing to assemble, lay the four legs side
by side on the bench top or fasten in the vise. Make
sure they are equal in length. Four and a half
inches from one end draw a pencil line with try
square across all four. Half an inch from the other
end draw a similar line; this end is to be the top.
These pencil lines are for locating the holes for the
screws, so that they will all be on the same level.
Bore a hole on each line with a bit or drill, large
enough so that the body of a round-head blue screw
either 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  or 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long will just slide through.</p>

<p>Before assembling, bevel or round the top of
each leg about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch. Fasten the four legs to
the top with the screws, slip the shelf into position,
and make fast in the same manner. Stand the
tabourette on a level surface, and if it needs levelling,
proceed as explained in the making of saw horse.</p>


<h3>TABOURETTE NUMBER TWO</h3>

<p>Tabourette number two may be modified by
designing legs with slight curves. Before cutting
these, lay out the four mortises just as the centres
for screw holes were located in previous model so
that all four will be equally distant from the floor.
Cut out mortises by boring several holes within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>the space to be cut and finish to line with chisel.
These mortises should be laid out on both sides of
the leg by squaring lines around the four sides.</p>

<p>The top needs no description, as it is just a
plain octagon. The principal work in this model
is on the cross pieces. They should be laid out
carefully, side by side, to make sure that the distance
across from shoulder to shoulder is exactly alike
on both. The tenon may have two shoulders, as
shown at <i>b</i>, or only one, as at <i>a</i>, but in either case
the mortises cut in the legs must exactly fit the
tenon. The halved joint in the centre must also
be carefully fitted.</p>

<p>When all the parts are ready to assemble, drill
two holes near the top of each leg for the round-head
screws. Insert all the tenons into their mortises
and fasten the legs to the top. A little glue may be
used in the mortise and tenon joints and one brad
should then be driven from the side or edge of each
leg through the tenon. Sink the brad below the
surface with nail set.</p>


<h3>TABOURETTE NUMBER THREE</h3>

<p>See chapter on <a href="#III">mechanical drawing</a> for laying out
hexagon. This form will appear crude unless the
legs are modified, and two or three suggestions for
this are shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
The construction consists in fastening to the under
side of the top piece a hexagon of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch pine
eight inches in diameter, making sides four inches
long. Every alternate side of this under piece
should be made with a sloping edge to conform to the
slant of the legs, of which there are only three. Drill
or bore four holes in each leg, two <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch from the
upper edge, and two to hold the hexagonal shelf.
The top edge of the legs should be bevelled with a
block plane to fit snugly against the under side of
the top. Three sides of the shelf&mdash;every alternate
one&mdash;should be bevelled in the same way to fit
against the inside of the legs.</p>

<p>When ready to assemble, fasten pine hexagon
to the under side of the top with six 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch screws.

<div class="caption">Fig. 178. Two styles of tabourettes</div>

</div>

<p>Attach the legs to the three sloping edges of this
under hexagon lightly with round-head screws.
Leave the screw heads projecting about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch until
the shelf has been fastened in position, then drive
them home with the screw-driver. This is one
of the simplest of tabourettes to make, but it is
open to criticism. The sloping legs give it a wide
base so that it is less easily upset than the other
forms; but the pressure from above tends to spread
them and pull the structure apart. This tendency
must be counteracted by a tie piece, which in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>case is only a shelf held by screws, some of which
are in end grain.</p>

<p>Of course any form may be criticised. The most
beautiful of all, the Turkish or Moorish, on account
of its overhanging top and small base, is the most
easily upset, and in designing new forms all these
points must be considered.</p>


<h3>TABOURETTE NUMBER FOUR</h3>

<p>This is an ideal example of the mission type taken
from Mr. Fred D. Cranshaw's book, "Problems in
Furniture Making." It calls for forty mortise and
tenon joints, and as it is usually made in oak,
it requires considerable time for laying out as well
as for cutting.</p>

<p>Twenty-four of these joints can be dispensed with
by panelling the sides in place of the lattice work.
By hinging the top and putting in a bottom, the
tabourette becomes a ladies' work box, a shoe
box, etc.</p>

<p>In a project of this kind it is absolutely necessary
to work systematically. Letter or number each part.
Mark the legs <i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> <i>d</i>, and proceed to work in pairs.
After squaring up all the pieces, take side <i>a b</i>. Lay
out the four joints on <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> which are to face each
other, finish these ready for assembling, lay aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
<i>a</i>, and lay out <i>b c</i>, etc. When you have finished all
four sides around to the starting point, stand the
four legs up in the position they are to occupy and
check up the work to see if any mistake has been
made. Treat the cross bars in the same way, marking
the tenons <i>a1</i>, <i>a2</i>, <i>b1</i>, <i>b2</i>, etc. When you have
gotten around the second time, assemble the whole
thing and look again for errors.</p>

<p>Take apart and lay out mortises in cross pieces
by pairs. Fasten 1 and 2 together in the vise with
the edges which are to face each other up as shown
in <a href="#fig177">Fig. 177</a>.</p>

<p>Square the lines across both pieces, remove from
vise and gauge the horizontal edges of mortises with
marking gauge.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion and for change of work, cut
out these mortises before laying out the next set,
and so for the third time work around to the starting
point.</p>

<p>A fourth trip around, making and fitting the
upright slats, and the tabourette is ready to assemble.
By using liquid glue, which hardens slowly, the whole
structure can be put together, fastened with large
hand screws or clamps, and left over night to dry.</p>

<p>While the glue is setting, measure carefully for
the top, to see if there is any variation from dimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>sions
on drawing, and cut out the top piece. By this
time, the amateur woodworker will have more respect
for the mission style than ever, and will appreciate
the difficulty of reaching simplicity.</p>

<p>The best method of securing the top is with small
angle irons fastened to it and cross pieces on the
inside. Invert the tabourette, after screwing the
angles to the cross pieces, and with the top on the
floor, drive home the last four screws.</p>

<p>No; it is not finished! There remains the polishing.
See <a href="#XLIX">Chapter XLIX</a>.</p>


<h3>TABOURETTE NUMBER FIVE</h3>

<p>This is so radically different in construction from
the previous forms that it requires special consideration.
Twelve edges must be planed to a 60-degree
mitre throughout their entire length and
the fit must be perfect. To accomplish this, first
cut out two hexagons from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch pine, 8 inches
in diameter, and exactly alike. Construct a special
shooting board, at least three inches longer than
the legs. Plane a strip of white pine to the shape
of a wedge whose angle is 30 degrees. Nail it to
the top of shooting board, as shown in <a href="#fig178">Fig. 178</a> at <i>a</i>.
By laying the piece to be mitred on this, the edge
can be planed to 60 degrees. Lay this on the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>pine hexagons as shown at <i>b</i>, and with the knife
make a mark at the angle <i>a</i> on both ends. Connect
these two points by a sharp line drawn with a
straight edge. Plane this edge on the shooting
board to point <i>a</i>, giving angle <i>a c</i>. Tack this leg
by brads to the two hexagons, at each extreme end,
driving brads only partly in, so that they can be
easily withdrawn. Fit the second leg to the first,
and so on around to the starting point. Number
or letter the legs, and the corresponding faces of
the hexagons, so that they may be easily replaced.</p>

<p>Next take off the legs, lay out and cut the openings
with the usual tools. These may be plain
Gothic arches or simple modifications.</p>

<p>When the legs are finished, make the hexagonal
top and prepare to assemble. Use the best glue.
Fasten the first leg in its original position on the
pine hexagons, using 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads at the top,
driving them all the way into the original holes.
Put a coating of glue on one edge throughout its
whole length, and rub the next leg up close into position.
The brads in the lower hexagon must be
driven in only part way, as they are to be removed
again. Put all six legs into position in this manner.
To bind the legs together while the glue is drying,
heavy cord should be wound around them, using
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>strips of wood to prevent marring the angles. Let
the whole stand over night.</p>

<p>Next day, plane off any glue that may show, removing
the two brads at the bottom, dressing down
one side at a time until you have reached the last
leg. The pine hexagon at the bottom may be taken
out, if it doesn't fall out. Sand-paper the sides with
No. 0 sand-paper, wrapped around a block.</p>

<p>The top only remains to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Drill six holes in the pine hexagon at the top, and
pass six <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  or <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch screws through from the
under side into the top piece by inverting, with top
on the floor.</p>

<p>There is so much careful work on this tabourette
that it is worthy of good material. Mahogany
is very suitable, the light coloured bay wood being
the cheapest variety; but of course other woods
will do. In case bay wood is used, it can be given
the appearance of old mahogany by first coating
it with a wash of potassium bichromate. Polish.</p>

<small>THE DOVETAIL JOINT</small></h2>


<p>While most mission furniture is put together
with the mortise and tenon joint,
cabinet work calls for the dovetail. All the
skill and accuracy possible are needed in dovetailing,
and when well put together with this style of joinery,
a piece of furniture should last indefinitely.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig179"></a><img src="images/fig179.jpg" width="300" height="277" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 179. The Dovetail Joint</div>

</div>

<p>The making of joints just for practice may not
be very interesting, but in the case of the dovetail
it is decidedly advisable. This is what Ralph
decided in Harry's case, and he was required to
make first a single open joint
as shown in <a href="#fig179">Fig. 179</a>. The
piece marked <i>a</i> was laid out
first, after squaring up the
stock, and the shaded portion
removed with back saw and
chisel, sawing so close to the
oblique lines that no chiselling
was required on these two
sides. Piece <i>b</i> was next fastened upright in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>vise, piece <i>a</i> being laid over <i>b</i> in a horizontal position,
and the form of the dovetail scribed with a
knife point. In other words, the first
piece cut out was used as a template
for laying out the second. The form
of the dovetail appeared in knife lines
on the end of piece <i>b</i>. The laying out
of <i>b</i> was then completed as shown at <i>d</i>.
The darkened portions were removed
with back saw and chisel, and the two
parts carefully fitted and glued together.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a id="fig180"></a><img src="images/fig180.jpg" width="150" height="270" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 180. The Dovetail Joint</div>

</div>

<p>This method of laying out dovetails is much surer
than that of laying out each piece separately according
to the dimensions, as any variation from the figures
is duplicated on the second piece, so that they must fit.</p>

<p>This single dovetail was followed by a box dovetail
joint comprising three dovetails on one piece,
as shown in <a href="#fig180">Fig. 180</a>. The method was the same
as before, the three spaces being laid out, sawed,
and chiselled. After testing to see that the bottoms
of the cuts were square, piece <i>f</i> was laid out, cut, and
fitted. Seven-eighths pine is good for this practice
work, but white wood gives better practice, in that it
is harder, and the dovetails cannot be forced together
without breaking, unless the fit is good. The harder
the stock used, of course the more true this is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>After successfully making these two practice
joints, the boy was ready to try his skill at cabinet
work. He began with a toilet box in black walnut,
to be inlaid later and polished. The over-all dimensions
were 11 &times; 7 &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches, the height, exclusive
of top and bottom pieces, being three inches.</p>

<p>The bill of material read:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 181. The dovetail joint used in box design</div>
</div>

<p>The process was as follows: Sides squared up
and tested. Ends squared up and tested. Sides
and ends compared to see if all were exactly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>same height. Dovetail joints laid out on side pieces.
(The two sides can be glued together with paper
between, and cut at the same time, but on this first
box the boys laid out each side separately.)</p>

<p>Joints cut and chiselled to line and lettered <i>a
b c d</i>. This was to avoid confusion in laying out
the ends from the sides. Ends laid out from sides
with knife. Ends cut and fitted to sides. This short
description meant the fitting of four box dovetails,
or twelve individual dovetail joints, and it took
considerable time. The four pieces were glued and
fastened in hand screws over night. Particular care
was taken to see that the pressure was evenly distributed,
so as not to throw the box out of square.</p>

<p>While the glue was hardening, the top and
bottom were squared up half an inch shorter and
half an inch narrower than the finished box was
to be.</p>

<p>A quarter-inch rabbet was cut on the four edges
of both top and bottom. When the box was taken
out of the hand screws next day the rabbet allowed
top and bottom to fit sides and ends as shown in
<i>g</i> (<a href="#fig181">Fig. 181</a>). They were glued into position, and
again placed in hand screws.</p>

<p>This construction left a quarter-inch rabbet
all around the top and bottom of the box. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>space was to be filled with square pieces of white
holly as an ornamental feature. While the glue
was hardening a second time, these little square
strips were prepared. The boys found that it
would not be necessary to square up the four sides,
for if one corner were made perfectly square, the
other sides could be planed off after the strips were
glued on.</p>

<p>When the hand screws were removed again, all
traces of glue in the rabbet were carefully taken off
with a sharp chisel. The strips of holly were sawed
in the mitre box, and fitted around the four sides
of top and bottom. The construction at this
stage is shown at <i>h</i>, with the holly strips projecting
beyond the walnut sides, ends and top.</p>

<p>The strips were fitted and glued in position, and
then held in place during the drying process by
winding the box in all directions with stout
twine.</p>

<p>When thoroughly hard and dry, the whole thing
was squared up, as if it were a solid block, and
scraped with a steel scraper.</p>

<p>Gauge lines were then made for the cover, as
described in the chapter on toilet boxes, sawed,
fitted, hinged, and polished.</p>

<p>When a box like this is to be inlaid, the inlaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>should be done after the squaring up, but before
the cover is sawed off.</p>

<p>The method of ornamenting the edges by strips
of different coloured woods may be omitted, and the
work considerably simplified by gluing the top
and bottom on, as shown in <a href="#fig181">Fig. 181</a> at <i>i</i>, and if
this seems too crude, a bevel <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch on the sides
and ends and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch on the top can be made with
the plane. Still another method is to round the
edges as shown at <i>j</i>.</p>

<p>Where the top is to be inlaid, either <i>j</i> or <i>k</i> is
preferable, as ornamented corners combined with a
decorated top is rather too much ornamentation
for good taste.</p>

<br />
<small>INLAYING</small></h2>


<p>In our search for the simple life with its mission
furniture, etc., inlaying has become almost a
lost art, but it is so easily done, and if used
in moderation so pleasing to the eye, that every boy
ought to try it at least.</p>

<p>If simple designs are adhered to, the results are
bound to be satisfactory. The materials required
are a few pieces of veneering of different thicknesses
and two or more kinds of wood. Veneering can
be obtained from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick down to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub>  inch,
but for ordinary work the thickness should be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
inch, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>  inch, and the woods,
ebony, holly, walnut, mahogany.</p>

<p>A good collection for simple designs is:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="simple designs">
<tr><td align="left"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch ebony, holly, mahogany</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch holly, rosewood, walnut</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>-inch holly, mahogany</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The tools required are a mitre box, back saw,
socket chisel, and mallet.</p>

<p>The process consists of building up the design,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>cutting out the opening, gluing the design in the
opening, and dressing down.</p>


<h3>BUILDING UP THE DESIGN</h3>

<p>It pays to make a full-sized drawing of the design,
as the relation of the inlaid work to the space it
is to occupy is important. For a box proportioned
like the one just described, 11 &times; 7 inches, the inlaid
design should be in about the same general proportion.
A square centre piece in such an oblong
space would not look well; it should be about one
and a half times as long as the width. The best
plan is to draw the box top full size and then carefully
work up the design.</p>

<p>This sort of designing will be a new experience,
as the veneering is all cut in a mitre box, no tool
but a saw being used, and this fact limits the designs.</p>

<p>Several pieces of the veneer are glued together
and placed in hand screws over night.</p>

<p>Suppose the combination shown at <a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a> is
used. Five thicknesses composed of two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch
walnut, next two of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch holly, and in the centre
one <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch ebony, will make a strong combination
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig182"></a><img src="images/fig182.jpg" width="600" height="932" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 182. Inlaid designs cut in a 45-degree mitre box</div>
</div>

<p>The dimensions should be about 18 inches long
by 3 inches wide. These five pieces when glued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>together make a solid piece 18 &times; 3 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches.
This built up board is sawed into strips <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch
thick, and these strips <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch form the basis
of the design.</p>

<p>In drawing the centre piece, border, or whatever
form the inlay is to take, it must be constantly
kept in mind that <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch is the width of the pieces.
<a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a> shows the shapes possible on a 45-degree
mitre box. Four pieces like <i>a</i> make a square.
To make an oblong design from this shape, ten
pieces will give <i>b</i>. Four pieces like <i>d</i> will give a
hollow square, in which may be fitted a piece of
fancy wood such as rosewood, snake wood, satinwood,
or some other South American wood.</p>

<p>The Greek cross is a favourite figure, and it is
composed of twelve pieces, eight like <i>f</i>, and four
like <i>a</i>. Some of its variations are shown in <i>c c</i>.</p>

<p>This design can be elaborated as shown at <i>e</i>.
Some of the most pleasing combinations are extremely
simple. An oblong piece of beautiful wood
such as bird's-eye maple, with a simple mitred frame,
is far more satisfying than the more complicated
figures.</p>

<p>The Swastika is a favourite among boys, and it
is shown at <a href="#fig183">Fig. 183</a> applied to an oblong box design.
In such a figure the border strips are not put on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>until all the pieces for the Swastika are cut out,
fitted, and glued.</p>

<p>In many of these designs two, three, and sometimes
four gluings are necessary. The pieces, having been
cut and fitted, are all brought together on a piece
of paper and glued with liquid
glue. The hot glue dries too
quickly. The paper holding the
design is laid on a piece of pine
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick, and wire brads
driven into the pine up close to
the inlay to hold the design together while it dries.
Two nails should be used against each piece of
the outside border. These nails may be used to
exert pressure by bending them with the fingers
over the design to force the pieces together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig183"></a><img src="images/fig183.jpg" width="600" height="426" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 183. The Swastika used as an inlay</div>

</div>

<p>When each piece has been pressed into place, allow
it to stand over night. Next day bend the nails
back, and lift the design, paper and all, out of its
nail fence, tear off the paper and cut away any glue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>that projects beyond the edges with a knife or
chisel.</p>

<p>You now have a solid inlaid design <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick
ready for use. Find by measurement the exact
place where you want this figure, lay it on the surface
and with a sharp knife scribe a line around the
design. Place the inlay to one side, and cut out
to a depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch the whole space inside the
knife lines. This can be done with socket chisel
and mallet, or with a router. The final cut should
be made with the chisel, bevel side in and straight
down.</p>

<p>You now have a space cut in the surface the exact
size of the design, except possibly the depth. Coat
the bottom of this space with glue, press the design
down into the space and hammer it tight with the
mallet and block of soft wood.</p>

<p>Allow the glue to harden thoroughly, plane the
design down to the surface, scrape, and sand-paper.</p>

<p>This is one of the things much more easily done
than described on paper.</p>

<p>Instead of the solid designs just described, an
inlaid border is sometimes preferable. <a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a>
at <i>g</i> gives a good idea of a very neat one. In this
case, the groove to receive the inlay is drawn directly
on the surface of the box, and cut out to the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>depth, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch. The pieces of inlay are sawed out
in the mitre box and fitted into the groove individually,
but not glued until the entire border has
been fitted. They are done all at one time, and
then a piece of board is laid over the whole top,
and it is placed in hand screws over night.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 184. Built up borders for inlaying</div>

</div>

<p>The number of combinations which can be obtained
from three or four veneers of different thicknesses
is astonishing, but perhaps the most interesting
form is called built up work. <a href="#fig184">Fig. 184</a> shows
several forms of built up borders. The method
of making <i>a</i> is as follows:</p>

<p>Ebony and holly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick are required
and two separate combinations are glued up, one
containing two pieces of holly with one ebony, and
the second two of ebony with one holly.</p>

<p>When dry, saw out of each combination a strip
an inch or an inch and a quarter wide. From strip
No. 1 saw a dozen or more pieces an inch or so
long. To make these pieces exactly alike, drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>a nail into the bottom of the mitre box an inch from
the 90-degree saw cut. By pushing the strip up to
this nail each time a cut is made the pieces must
be the same length.</p>

<p>For combination No. 2, shift the nail to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch
from the saw cut, and saw out an equal number of
pieces as from No. 1.</p>

<p>By gluing these pieces together alternately,
border <i>a</i> will result. It is necessary on these built
up combinations to add an outside retaining
strip of thin veneer to hold the pieces rigidly
together.</p>

<p>When the final gluing has dried, the usual <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
strip should be
sawed out. This is
best done on a power,
band, or circular saw,
but it can be done
by hand if the rip saw is good and sharp.</p>

<p>Other built up combinations may be handled in
the same way. For square spaces, the checker-board
is a great favourite. It calls for a dark and
light veneer of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thickness. Glue up four
light and four dark pieces in alternation as shown in
<a href="#fig185">Fig. 185</a>. When hard, saw out eight strips as wide
as the veneer is thick. Glue these eight strips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>together, reversing four of them, so that the black
and white squares come together. The result will
be a solid piece one inch square, and by sawing
off <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch slices, each slice will be a checker-board
composed of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch cubes.</p>

<p>The very best glue obtainable is needed for this
work, especially if the woods are ebony and holly,
as these are so hard that the glue cannot penetrate.</p>

<p>When a 30-60-90-degree mitre box is used to
cut the strips, an entirely different class of designs
is obtained. <a href="#fig186">Fig. 186</a> shows some of the endless
possibilities of these combinations. They are suitable
for the top and shelf of an hexagonal tabourette,
and the oblong figures are suitable for the top of an
oblong box or the space between the wells of an inkstand.</p>

<p>Some of the simplest yet most effective forms give
the impression of overlapping shown at <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig183">Fig. 183</a>, this
being an oblong piece of fancy wood with a narrow
mitred frame around the four sides; <i>b b</i> are pieces
of the same kind of wood but different from <i>a</i>, with
a narrow frame on three sides; <i>a</i> appears to be
laid over <i>b</i>, and <i>c c</i>, still another kind of wood,
both cut from the same piece.</p>

<p>It looks more uniform and harmonious if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>frames of the five pieces representing three distinct
kinds of wood are the same.</p>

<p>It is important in choosing these borders to see
that the outside veneer be in marked contrast to
the surface into which the design is to be set.</p>

<p>A very simple centre piece may be made interesting
by surrounding a plain oblong or rectangle of
rare wood with an interlaced border.</p>

<p>Inlaying of curved designs means some difficulty
in accurately cutting out the opening to fit the
design; but this is overcome by reverting to the
ancient art called marquetry work. Three or more
veneers <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch thick are glued together at the
corners and the design drawn or glued on the top
layer.</p>

<p>Suppose the figure is that of a butterfly. Assume
that the veneers are holly, mahogany, and rosewood.
With a fine fret saw cut or saw directly on the lines.
The three thicknesses being sawed at one time,
the pieces must exactly fit. The rosewood may
be used for the outer edge of the wings, the holly
for the main part of the wings, and the mahogany
for the body. As all these parts fit accurately,
they may be glued to a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch backing piece and
dried under the pressure of hand screws. Flowers,
birds, etc., in infinite variety, and even landscapes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>can be cut out and used in this way. Veneers
coloured green are on the market and may be used
for leaves or foliage effects.</p>

</div>

<p>A great deal might be written about this old style
of ornamental woodwork, but it would deal almost
entirely with questions of design, as the method
would be practically the same in every case. One
form of this interesting art is called buhl work, in
which sheet brass, German silver, or even the precious
metals are used. Brass and ebony were a favourite
combination at one time, the two layers being glued
together with paper between. The design was
sawed out, and then a sharp knife blade inserted
into the joint to separate the brass from the ebony.
That gave two distinct designs. In one case it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>a brass background with ebony inlay. In the other,
an ebony background with brass inlay.</p>

<p>There will always be as many resulting combinations
as there are original layers of material. A
backing of cheap material is always necessary to
support the finished work to which it must be securely
glued. In polishing the finished surface, a steel
scraper must first be used, followed by fine sand-paper;
then polish.</p>

<p>Some of the newer forms of decoration, while
lacking the richness of inlaid work, admit of greater
freedom. Pyrography, for example, is closely akin
to drawing, and in the hands of a careful worker
may be made to produce very artistic effects. Like
all arts, it also has its limitations. In woods of
the pine family, it will not do at all, on account of
the pitchy sap. In dark-coloured or very hard
woods, it is equally unsatisfactory, so that it is
used almost exclusively on basswood, because of
the white colour, softness, even grain, and freedom
from pitch.</p>

<p>Outfits for pyrography may be purchased quite
reasonably. They consist of a glass bottle containing
benzine; the vapour from this is forced through
a rubber tube by means of a bulb held in the left
hand out to a platinum point. This point is first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>heated in the flame of an alcohol lamp sufficiently
to ignite the benzine vapour as it comes out through
openings in the point.</p>

<p>While the left hand keeps pumping the vapour,
the right hand guides the point along the lines of
the design, which has been drawn or traced on the
wood.</p>

<p>Many articles made and stamped with designs
are to be had at the art stores; but the joy and satisfaction
in achievement come from making the
articles and originating the designs.</p>

<p>Basswood is very easily soiled by handling and a
coat of white shellac should be applied after the
burning is finished. Sometimes staining is used
on certain parts of the design, as for flowers or
fruit, and in that case the staining must be done before
the shellac is applied.</p>

<br />
<small>THE CHECKER-BOARD</small></h2>


<p>A favourite project among young woodworkers
is the checker-board. While it
is closely akin to inlaying, the method
of making it to avoid unnecessary labour is here
suggested. As the checker-board consists of sixty-four
squares of equal size and divided equally between
two kinds of wood, one dark and the other
light, some way must be devised to insure their
being exactly alike to make the board a success.
Considerable care should be used in the selection
of the woods, for while they must present a strong
contrast in colour, they should be as nearly as possible
of the same degree of hardness, to make the working
uniform.</p>

<p>If soft woods are used, red gum and basswood
make an agreeable contrast in colour. Basswood
is not a very satisfactory wood to polish in its
natural colour, however.</p>

<p>Among the hard woods, a combination of black
walnut and rock maple, or mahogany and maple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>or even cherry and maple, can be used. Any one
of these combinations will be more satisfactory in
the finished work than the soft woods mentioned.
The work will be harder of course, but in woodwork
as in other things, nothing really good is obtained
without effort.</p>

<p>Assuming that the woods have been selected, four
strips of dark and the same number in light coloured
wood should be squared up to a width of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  or 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches according to the size of the squares to be made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"> Fig. 187. Method of making a checker-board</div>
</div>

<p>As in other woodworking problems, have a full-sized
or half-sized mechanical drawing ready before
using a tool.</p>

<p>A checker-board built up of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch squares
will be ten inches square without the frame. (See
<a href="#fig187">Fig. 187</a>.) With 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch squares, it will be twelve
inches on each side. This is amply large and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>satisfactory working size. The material should be
either <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch or <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick. Plane the strips
about sixteen inches long by one inch and a half
wide.</p>

<p>Lay the four strips of dark wood on edge on the
bench top and carefully fasten the four in the vise.
Remove a light shaving to insure their width
being all alike.</p>

<p>Treat the light strips the same way.</p>

<p>Next place all eight strips together and examine
for inequalities. Too much care cannot be exercised
at this point, as the success of the problem
depends on it.</p>

<p>To make doubly sure, reverse every alternate
strip end for end, and if inequalities appear place
all eight strips in the vise and remove a light shaving.
One of the best methods for making these strips
of equal size and with perfectly square edges is
to construct a shooting board, or arrange one
already made, as shown at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The strip <i>s</i> is set to a gauge line made 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches
from the edge. The strips are laid in this space
and planed in the usual way, until the plane touches
the stop. This makes the width of all pieces the
same and gives true edges.</p>

<p>These eight strips placed alternately light and dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>are now glued upon a backing of soft wood, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch or
less in thickness. Gluing must be done thoroughly,
each strip being rubbed back and forth until a good
joint is made with its neighbour.</p>

<p>A piece of newspaper is spread over the top,
heavy pieces of flat stock placed top and bottom, and
the pressure from several hand screws applied while
the glue is drying.</p>

<p>The best liquid glue obtainable should be used,
and the paper on top prevents the hand screws being
glued to the wood.</p>

<p>This combination must stand until the glue is
thoroughly hard, if it takes forty-eight hours, which
it does sometimes in damp weather.</p>

<p>When dry, remove hand screws and tear off paper.
Square outside edges if backing projects or glue
adheres. With a large try square or steel square
lay out parallel lines across the combination 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches apart. Saw on the lines with cross cut saw,
unless a mill is handy, when it can be done more
accurately with a circular or band saw.</p>

<p>The new strips will be 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches wide, less the
amount removed by the saw. Dress them down to
a width of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches on the shooting board. This
should bring the eight pieces on each strip to squares
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches on a side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>Eight of these strips make the checker-board.
The original pieces, being sixteen inches long, allow
for two or three extra strips in case any are spoiled
in sawing or planing.</p>

<p>These finished strips are now to be glued together
on the permanent backing, which should be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  or
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch in thickness, of the same material as the
frame is to be and about eight inches each way
longer and wider than the checker-board proper.</p>

<p>This should be placed carefully in the centre of
the backing, joints rubbed and fastened by cleats
1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch tacked to the backing on all four sides.</p>

<p>While this is drying under pressure of the hand
screws as in the first gluing, square up the moulding
which is to act as a frame: <i>d</i> shows two styles. In
both mouldings, a rabbet <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch or so wide and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
inch deep should be made with rabbet plane. The
outer edges may be square, rounded, or bevelled.</p>

<p>When the checker-board is removed from its final
gluing, this moulding is to be mitred and fitted about
it as in making a picture frame. Before doing this,
remove all glue from edges with a chisel so that the
frame will fit snugly to the checker-board.</p>

<p>The frame is to be glued to both backing and
checker-board and again placed in hand screws.
While this is drying, an inlaid border strip as wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>as the rabbet, either plain or built up, should be
prepared.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 188. Checker-board tables</div>
</div>

<p>This strip, as well as the rabbet, may be omitted
entirely, but should the frame be of the same material
as one of the woods used in the checker-board it is
necessary, and in any case it adds
a finish to the work that is very
pleasing. Inlaid designs may be
set into the frame and a very
elaborate result obtained, if
desired.</p>

<p>After this last gluing, set in
the inlay, and when dry, plane,
scrape, and sand-paper the whole
surface flat, and square the edges
of the frame.</p>

<p>This makes a very substantial
and heavy board, worthy of any
woodworker and worthy of being used as a
table top. Such a table may be constructed
as shown in <a href="#fig188">Fig. 188</a>. It calls for mortise and
tenon joints cut at an angle, and if this style of
work is considered too difficult vertical legs
can be used. This under structure should be of
the same kind of wood as the frame of the checker-board,
and if oak is used the stain should be applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>before placing the inlaid border. Bay wood is preferable
to oak for inlaying but is more expensive.</p>

<p>On a small table of this size, where vertical legs
are used, the base is so small that the structure is
top-heavy and easily upset, so that the problem
becomes a very interesting study in design.</p>

<p>When the entire table has been put together,
polish it. If mahogany, finish in natural colour;
if oak, any of the styles described in the chapter
on staining may be used, with care taken to keep
the checker-board itself in the natural colours.</p>

<small>TOOL CASES AND CHESTS</small></h2>


<p>After our boys had made several dovetailed
and inlaid boxes, Ralph announced that his
pupil was ready to attack the construction of
a tool cabinet. It was to be fastened to the wall
over the bench, designed to hold most of the small
tools, and to be in such a position that it could be
reached from the front of the bench.</p>

<p>The cabinet designed was really a dovetailed box
30 &times; 20 &times; 6 inches over all. It was made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
quartered oak except the back, which was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
pine. The bill of material was:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="bill of material">
<tr><td align="left">1 piece pine 30 &times; 20 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></td>
<td class="tpl">2 pieces oak 20 &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1 piece oak&nbsp;  30 &times; 20 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> </td>
<td class="tpl">2 pieces oak 30 &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The front and back, each 30 &times; 20 inches, were made
of two pieces 30 &times; 10 inches, jointed and glued,
placed in clamps over night and the joints planed
down to take off the excess glue which had oozed
out under pressure of the clamps. While these two
parts were gluing, the sides and ends were dovetailed
as in previous boxes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig189"></a><img src="images/fig189.jpg" width="600" height="363" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 189. A tool cabinet</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>When the front and back pieces were glued in
place on the box, they were further fastened by
1-inch brads, set below the surface, and the
holes filled with putty, coloured to correspond with
the stain. The colour of the finish was a dark, handsome
green. The box was sawed in two along a line
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches from the front.</p>

<p>This divided the cabinet into two parts, the door
or front section having a clear depth of 2 inches,
and the back or wall section a depth of 3 inches.</p>

<p>After hinging the door section in position, the
cabinet was stained inside and out, the outside
polished and a hook for fastening the door shut was
placed in position.</p>

<p>The cabinet was fastened to the studding of the
shop by four strong screws 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches long. The
var<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>ious nails, hooks, and tool racks were next added
and the cabinet was ready to use.</p>

<p>Patent racks for holding chisels, gouges, etc.,
are sold in hardware stores, but our boys preferred
to make their own. Their chisel rack is shown in
<a href="#fig189">Fig. 189</a>.</p>

<p>After squaring up and cutting out the recesses
at the ends, holes were bored, the opening from the
front cut with back saw, and the sharp edges rounded
with chisel and sand-paper.</p>

<p>Holes for the screws at the ends were bored and
countersunk.</p>

<p>In locating a tool cabinet of this kind, while it
should be very easily reached, and is usually open
during work hours, it should be placed high enough
so as to be easily opened or closed without striking
tools and work on the bench. In other words, it
should not be necessary to clear the bench top in
order to open the cabinet. About 6 inches between
under side of tool cabinet and bench top is
about right.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned tool chest, suitable for shipping
a whole kit of tools any distance, is shown in <a href="#fig190">Fig.
190</a>. These chests were usually fitted with trays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>divided into compartments for small tools and
hardware. Such a chest may be made of either
hard or soft wood and its construction is as follows:</p>

<p>After making out a list of material, square up
sides and ends exactly as in making any box. Lay
out, cut and fit the dovetails. The bottom, on
account of its width, will have to be made of two
pieces. These may be jointed, glued and placed
in clamps or put together with a tongue and groove
joint. The latter plan calls for a special plane.
Having prepared the bottom by either of these
methods, bore and countersink holes about 6 inches
apart in the bottom and secure rigidly to sides and
ends by 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  or 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch flat-head screws.</p>

<p>For the top, make a frame from <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch
thick and 3 or 4 inches wide, putting the ends together
with end lap or mortise and tenon joints.</p>

<p>Secure this frame to top of box by screws. These
may be round-heads, or if it is desirable to hide them,
the method shown in <a href="#fig190">Fig. 190</a> can be used. This is
accomplished by boring a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole through the
top frame. At the same centre a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch hole is
bored partly through. The screw is driven home
and a round wooden plug glued into the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
hole. When dry, this plug is sawed off and planed
smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>The top frame having been secured, two gauge
lines are made for sawing the cover, as in previous
boxes, and the two parts dressed to gauge lines, ready
for hinging.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 190. The old-fashioned tool chest</div>
</div>

<p>Before putting on the hinges, the top is to be
finished with a
raised panel.
Square up a
piece of stock
two inches
longer and
wider than the
open space in the top frame. Round upper edges,
and secure to frame by flat-head screws from the
under side through holes bored and countersunk.</p>

<p>Next put on hinges, which should be large and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>strong, the variety known as strap hinges. Cut
out space for lock, and fit. The holes for key are
bored with a gimlet bit and cut out enough to allow
the key to enter freely; or hasp, staple and padlock
may be used.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 191. Suit case tool chest</div>

</div>

<p>The bevelled base is mitred at corners, and brass
corner plates to protect these lower corners are
added.</p>

<p>The strip at the top corresponding to the base
may be mitred and protected with corner plates,
or the ordinary butt joint can be used. The bevel
on this strip may be omitted. A chest of this
variety, made of pine and painted, will stand a great
deal of rough usage. Iron or brass handles at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>ends are recommended for convenience in carrying.
Our boys were not satisfied with this form of
tool chest, as it required two people to carry it,
and after some experimenting they evolved one
in the form of a dress suit case, long, narrow, and
high, that could be easily carried. It is shown in
<a href="#fig191">Fig. 191</a>.</p>

<p>They first made a solid box 30 &times; 15 &times; 7 inches
over all. It was put together with butt joints
securely nailed, using <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch white wood.</p>

<p>One quarter of the box was sawed out, as shown
on the end view, and hinged to the body by ornamental
brass hinges. This quarter was fitted for
two saws by making two blocks as shown in the
drawing. The rip and cross cut saws were fitted
into the saw kerfs cut in these two blocks, placed
securely in the cover, and were held in place by a
small piece of leather strap taken from a school
book strap and nailed to inside of cover. A tray
for small tools was made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch stock the full
length and width of the inside of the chest 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches
deep and made to rest flush with the top of lower
section on little corner strips glued in the four
corners.</p>

<p>For handle, two pieces of leather strap were
secured, one to each top section, by screws. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>the box was closed, these two straps came together
and made a good handle. The objection to a
solid handle is that it must be entirely on one section
and that takes it out of the centre, so that the weight
is not evenly distributed.</p>

<p>This is one of the most satisfactory styles of tool
carrier devised. It will hold practically the whole
kit and may be picked up like a dress suit case and
transported just as readily. A hook and eye or
hasp, staple and padlock should be used to hold
the case securely closed.</p>

<p>For carrying bits of various kinds and sizes, a roll
of ticking or denim divided into separate spaces
is very desirable. These rolls with straps are sold
in tool houses, but may be made at home by the
sewing department. Besides protecting the cutting
edges, they help to keep out dampness and rust.</p>

<h3>THE WALL RACK</h3>

<p>In the modern home, the orderly arrangement
of books and magazines calls for ample shelf
space and the book shelf becomes a favourite
piece of furniture among amateur woodworkers.
The book rack for the books of the day has been
taken up in Chapter XXVII. The book shelf for
hanging on the wall is blocked out in <a href="#fig192">Fig. 192</a>.</p>

<p>The questions to be considered in the design are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>No. 1. Methods of fastening shelves to ends.</small></p>

<p><small>No. 2. The design of the ends.</small></p>

<p><small>No. 3. The back: is it necessary, and if so shall it be solid?
Outline of back.</small></p>

<p><small>No. 4. Method of fastening to wall.</small></p>

</blockquote>

<p>No. 1. The method of bringing shelves and ends
together with plain butt joint and fastening with a
round-head screw from the outside is the easiest
and poorest. The whole weight on the shelves is
carried by the screws. This method is shown at <i>a</i>.
At <i>b</i>, a better method is indicated, the shelf being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>gained into the end and held in position by the
screws. The weight in this case is carried by the
ends. To hide the joint, the shelf may be slightly
narrower than the end piece as shown in the top
view at <i>c</i>, or the two
parts may be of the
same width as at <i>d</i>, the
gained joint stopping
half an inch or so short of the full width. These
details apply to bookcases that stand on the floor
as well as to smaller ones.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 192. The problem of designing a wall book rack</div>

</div>

<p>No. 2. The design of the ends is largely a matter
of artistic taste, and where curves are used, the lower
part is usually formed in such a way as to suggest
a bracket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>No. 3. A back is only necessary to give the rack
rigidity and to protect the wall. If made solid&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
to cover the whole space between ends&mdash;it uses
a good deal of wood and adds considerable weight.
<i>E</i> shows a method of using only top and bottom
strips. They will make the rack sufficiently rigid
and the strip should be gained into the ends, bringing
them flush with the back of end pieces.</p>

<p>No. 4. Find the location of wall studs by dropping
a line with weight on it (plumb) from the
nails on picture moulding, or by bringing the weight
in front of nails on base board. Make fine pencil
marks on the wall where the studs have been located.
Find the horizontal distance between the marks
and at this distance drill holes in back of book rack
and secure to the studs by screws. This brings all
the strain on the back strips. If the rack has no
back, square up two hard wood strips about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inch square and as long as the shelves. Drill
screw holes in these strips and fasten to studs.
Drill vertical holes at the back of each shelf <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
inch in from edge, fit the shelves over cleats and
screw down into them from upper side of shelves.</p>

<p>The cleats should be finished in the same colour
as the book rack. This method makes a very solid
and permanent fastening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>The length of a wall rack should be limited ordinarily
to three feet, as the weight of three feet of
books will give considerable sag to the shelves, and a
greater length will call for a vertical partition and
corresponding bracket underneath for its support.</p>


<h3>THE BOOKCASE</h3>

<p>This piece of furniture is seen in so many forms
that a volume would be necessary simply to catalogue
them. The essential features are strong ends
or sides, usually a solid back, a base, shelves, often
adjustable as to spacing, a top more or less ornamental,
and often glass doors.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important point in the construction
is strength. A wobbly bookcase is an abomination,
and the weight to be carried is frequently
enormous.</p>

<p>A typical case without doors will be taken up and
this may be modified, used as a unit and doubled or
trebled at the will of the young carpenter. (<a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a>.)</p>

<p>If it is made to occupy a certain space in a permanent
home, it may be built in and made solid
with the wall, but this is not often desirable, particularly
in America, where people move frequently.
As a general rule, two small bookcases are better
than one large one. They may be easily shifted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>changed from room to room, and are more apt to
fit between windows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig193"></a><img src="images/fig193.jpg" width="600" height="680" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 193. The bookcase</div>

</div>

<p>The uprights 4 feet 4 inches long, 8 inches wide
and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick, are
rabbeted at the back
so that the joint will
not show from the
side. The back is to
be of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch white
wood stained the same
colour as the sides.
The under top piece
and bottom are gained
into the sides, both joints being hidden by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>the later construction. The 3-inch bevelled base
is mitred at the corners and cut off square at
the back, covering only three sides, as the back is
to be flush from top to bottom. The top is to have
a moulded edge on three sides, and to be fastened to
under top piece by flat-head screws from the under
side through countersunk holes.</p>

<p>The four solid shelves are made adjustable in
their spacing by the old-fashioned method of sawtoothed
strips in each corner. Strips <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch
are made to fit in the toothed spaces, and the shelves
rest on these strips, of which two must be provided
for each shelf.</p>

<p>The four toothed strips should be laid out and
cut together to insure the shelves being level. The
dimensions for all these pieces are given in the
detailed drawings.</p>

<p>The front edges are covered by <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch strips,
beaded if desired, mitred at the top and cut to fit
the bevelled base below. Nailed on with brads, these
are set and the holes filled with putty, coloured to
match the finish.</p>

<p>In the mission style, the shelves are frequently
mortised through the sides and secured by pins
or wedges. In this type of bookcase, a solid back
is rarely used, and base and top are omitted. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>a design of this kind, the top shelf becomes a book
rack with ornamental ends. Often only the upper
and lower shelves are mortised, the others being
gained into the sides as described under wall racks.
The lower part of the side is frequently modified
to give a wider base and to make the case more
stable. One objection to this is the amount of
material wasted in cutting out, as the stock for
the sides must be the full width of the base.</p>

<small>THE MEDICINE CABINET</small></h2>


<p>The wall cabinet for drugs and toilet articles,
where the various household remedies may
be found quickly, is illustrated in <a href="#fig194">Fig. 194</a>.</p>

<p>It calls for a panelled door, the construction and
details of which are given in the drawing.</p>

<p>After squaring up the four pieces for styles
and rails, plough a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch groove <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  of an
inch deep on the inner edge of all the pieces.
This groove is to receive the panel which is planed
down to fit. The two uprights are to be mortised
at each end, as shown by dotted lines and edge view.</p>

<p>The tenons on the ends of the rails are cut with
a shoulder. This closes the space made by the
plough on the uprights, as shown in the top view.</p>

<p>The panel is squared up <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch larger each way
than the open space between rails and styles and a
long bevel is planed on each of the four sides, leaving
the thickness of the edges just great enough to
fit the bottom of the grooves of rails and styles.</p>

<p>Another method of making a panel is to use thin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>wood which will just fit the grooves, and to fill the
joints with a simple moulding mitred at the corners.</p>

<p>The raised panel is not difficult to make, however,
and there is little difference in the time consumed by
the two methods.</p>

<p>When the five parts are ready for assembling,
the mortise joints are glued, the panel slipped into
place and left free to shrink in the grooves. The
door is placed in hand screws or clamps over night.</p>

<p>As it is to fit a definite space, always make a door
slightly larger than its finished dimensions, to allow
for planing off and fitting.</p>

<p>While it is drying, proceed with the building of
the cabinet. The back inner edges of the sides are
to be rabbeted to receive the back, which may be
made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  or <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch white wood. Material for
the cabinet proper may be any hard wood, or even
white wood.</p>

<p>The shelves may be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch thick. Heavier
material is not necessary, on account of the short
span. They are to be gained into the sides to the
depth of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch. The spacing of the shelves
should be adapted to the sizes of bottles to be accommodated,
and the dimensions given in the drawing
are merely suggestive.</p>

<p>The overhanging top may be made either with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>moulded edges on front and sides or be left square.
It is secured by screws from the under side of the
false top.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 194. The medicine cabinet</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>The sides are shown modified at the bottom to give
a pleasing effect, and the back piece may either be
brought down and cut to a curved outline, as indicated
in the drawing, or stopped at the first shelf.</p>

<p>In assembling, first put the false top in place and
nail it to the sides; next put the top on with screws,
slip the shelves into their respective grooves, and
glue. Put on the back, nailing securely to sides and
shelves. To make the cabinet more rigid, drive
1-inch brads into the shelves from the outside
set and fill the holes.</p>

<p>Last of all, fit the door, and fasten it with hinges
and a catch. A lock may be used, but that is
hardly advisable, as in case of an emergency the
key may be lost at the critical moment. Stain
and polish.</p>

<p>The method of fastening is by screws through the
back into the wall studs.</p>

<p>Cabinets for various purposes can be designed
along the lines just described, but in each case the
method of construction is similar. A stronger
cabinet would result if the top and bottom shelves
were mortised through the sides in the mission style.
The only objection to this is that if the horizontal
space be limited, the projecting tenon may be in the
way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<a id="fig195"></a><img src="images/fig195.jpg" width="400" height="586" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 195. A filing cabinet</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
The filing cabinet for papers shown in <a href="#fig195">Fig. 195</a>
is of radically different construction. As it is
designed to stand on a desk, or independent shelf,
the base may be very simple or omitted entirely,
as in the drawing.</p>

<p>It is divided into twelve compartments, with a
clear space in each of 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches, these
being the outside dimensions of the drawers.</p>

<p>It is important in building up these compartments
to use lumber that is well seasoned and free from
warp. Gain the shelves into outside uprights, stopping
the groove half an inch from the front.</p>

<p>Before sliding the shelves into the grooves, lay
out on the four pieces the grooves for the three
vertical partitions. It will be much easier to cut
these grooves clear through from front to back, but
a better appearance from the front can be obtained
by stopping the grooves half an inch back, as on
the sides.</p>

<p>Each vertical partition will then consist of three
separate pieces slipped in from the back. A cross
section of the cabinet will appear, as <i>a</i>. The quarter-inch
back is to be gained into the sides as shown
in the top view.</p>

<p>The construction of the drawer is shown at <i>c</i>,
the sides being cut away toward the back. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>wise
the drawer is simply an open box made of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
pine or white wood, with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch bottom put
together with brads.</p>

<p>The false front, made of the same material as
top and sides, gives a suitable finish, and practically
covers all joints; it is secured by flat-head screws
from the inside.</p>

<p>In assembling the drawer, it should be made
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch smaller than the compartment it is to
fit, to prevent binding in damp weather.</p>

<p>Bay wood, a light-coloured mahogany, is very appropriate
for this piece of office furniture, the edges
of partitions being stained to match. A brass
drawer-pull, with a space left for a printed label, is
to be put on after the polishing is done.</p>

<p>Filing cabinets made by this method may, of
course, be made with drawers of different proportions
and with any number of compartments, but
this size is designed to hold long envelopes, letters,
bills, etc.</p>

<small>MISSION FURNITURE</small></h2>


<p>The library table (<a href="#fig196">Fig. 196</a>) is a good example
of solid and permanent furniture construction.
It represents the main principles of
the mission style&mdash;solidity, strength, simplicity,
straight lines, mortise and tenon joints, etc.</p>

<p>To a boy who has worked carefully up to this
point it is entirely possible.</p>

<p>As the top is the only part to be glued up,
this should be done first. Three boards
of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch quartered oak 10 inches wide, or an
equivalent that will aggregate a trifle over 30
inches, and 4 feet long, should be jointed and
prepared for dowelling. The method of doing this
is shown at <i>a</i>, where two jointed pieces are clamped
together. The distance between dowels lengthwise
should be measured, and lines squared across the
edges with knife and try square. Two pencil lines,
as at <i>b</i>, should be made across the joint. Set
the marking gauge at <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch. Remove the
boards from vise or clamp, and from the faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>touched by pencil lines, gauge lines cutting across
the three knife lines on each edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig196"></a><img src="images/fig196.jpg" width="600" height="728" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 196. A mission library table</div>

</div>

<p>Where these lines cross, bore <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch holes with a
dowel bit to the depth of at least 1 inch. Lay out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>the other dowelled joint in the same manner. Saw
six pieces of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch dowel 2 inches long, and glue
ends of each dowel in the holes prepared in the
middle board, as shown at <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Put a thin layer of glue on the joints with a brush
and clamp the three pieces together. While the
glue is hardening, proceed with the frame. This
consists of four legs, four top rails, the lower cross
rails, a shelf, and four wedges.</p>

<p>The sizes are as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="sizes">

</table></div>

<p>The construction of the top rails is shown at <i>d</i>
in the detail drawing. The only point calling for
special attention is to see that the tenons are flush
with outside of rail, being cut on only three sides,
and the mitre at the end of each. The necessity
for this mitre is shown in the drawing of the top of
leg at <i>e</i>, where the two tenons are shown meeting
in the blind mortises. The short rails are identical
with those shown at <i>d</i>, except in length.</p>

<p>The detailed drawing of the legs is shown at <i>f</i>,
and to make sure that the four are uniform, they
should be laid out in pairs, the two at one end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>together, then the second pair; and finally the two
pairs must be compared to discover any possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>inaccuracies. The cutting of the mortises may be
hastened by boring several holes inside the lines
from each side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig196a"></a><img src="images/fig196a.jpg" width="600" height="850" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 196. A mission library table (continued)</div>

</div>

<p>The drawing at <i>g</i> shows the layout of the lower
rails, with tenons at the ends, and mortises on flat sides
to receive the tenons on ends of the shelf. As in previous
cases, these two pieces should be laid out together.</p>

<p>The most difficult work up to this point is the
cutting of the two blind mortises at the top of each
leg to receive the mitred tenons. This operation
could be simplified, by replacing the mortise and tenon
at that point by a dowel joint, but it would no longer
be genuine mission furniture, and a much weaker
form of construction.</p>

<p>The drawing of the long shelf explains itself,
two tenons being cut at each end and a rectangular
hole cut through each tenon for the wedge.
The tenons are shown with a slight bevel, which
is cut with a chisel when all other work is finished.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, it will be wise to try
and fit all the joints. Number or letter the two
parts of each joint, as it is finished, to assist in the
final assembling. This process of fitting should
take some time, for it cannot be hurried safely.
When it is finished, the way to fasten the top to
the frame should be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>Several methods are in use, and two are shown
at <i>h</i> and <i>i</i>. At <i>h</i> a hole is bored at an angle in the
rail. As it goes only part way through, it provides
a shoulder for the screw head, and the screw is
driven through a hole drilled for the purpose into
the solid top.</p>

<p>If this method is used, at least ten screws would
be needed for a table of this size, three on each side
and two on each end.</p>

<p>The method shown at <i>i</i> is probably the better
of the two. Blocks of wood of the shape and size
given in the drawing are made and fitted into a
groove ploughed in the rails.</p>

<p>This groove may be ploughed the full length of rail,
or cut out for an inch or two with a chisel. The
tongue and groove should fit snugly, and the block be
securely fastened to the top with screws. Two blocks
on each side and one on each end will be sufficient.</p>

<p>A simple method is to fasten top and frame by
angle irons 2 inches long, on the inside.</p>

<p>This question having been decided, take the glued-up
top from clamps and dress down to size. The
under side should be trued up enough to fit neatly
over tops of legs and rails, and the upper side should
be planed, scraped, and sand-papered.</p>

<p>The final assembling should be done in this order:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>Assemble the two ends separately. Each end
consists of two legs, a top and a bottom rail. The
mortise and tenon joints should be glued, and a clamp
used at top and bottom. Test for squareness.
When dry, remove clamps, insert shelf tenons and
those of top rails in their mortises, and clamp lengthwise.
Drive a wire brad through each tenon, from
the side of leg least conspicuous, and set with nail
punch.</p>

<p>Put on the top, and level bottom of legs where
necessary. Remove all traces of glue, and fill brad
holes with putty, coloured same as stain to be used.</p>

<p>Place wedges in mortises provided, and fasten
each one with a small brad driven through the side
of shelf tenons. Stain and polish.</p>


<h3>THE TEA TABLE</h3>

<p>This table is made low purposely, the legs being
exactly two feet in length. The construction consists
of four legs, two sets of cross rails, and a circular
top two feet in diameter. As this top is too
wide to be cut from one board, joint two pieces of
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch stock, glue together, and place in clamp.
The joint may be strengthened with dowels, as in
previous cases. (<a href="#fig197">Fig. 197</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig197"></a><img src="images/fig197.jpg" width="600" height="634" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 197. A mission tea table</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
By proceeding in this order&mdash;gluing up first&mdash;no
time need be lost in waiting. Square up the four
legs and lay out the eight mortises, placing the four
pieces in a vise or clamp to insure uniformity. Cut
the mortises and lay the legs one side. The two
sets of cross rails are to be halved at the centre, and
may be straight
or slightly
curved, as
shown. The
curve improves
the appearance
without reducing
the strength
seriously, but if this form is decided on, the curve
must be cut before laying out the halved joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>After finishing the joint, the two rails of each set
are clamped together and tenons laid out. Remove
from clamp or vise and cut tenons. Test each set
to make sure the halved joint at centre is satisfactory,
and insert tenons in the mortises. Draw bore
and fasten with round pins of the same material as
the legs.</p>

<p>Before fastening the top rails in position, drill and
countersink two holes in each piece for the screws,
in the position shown in drawing. The bevels on
end of tenons should be cut with the chisel before
the final fastening.</p>

<p>The two boards composing the top when removed
from clamps should be dressed flat on
both sides, tested with a straight edge, and circle
laid out with steel dividers set at a radius of twelve
inches.</p>

<p>Saw close to this line with turning saw, chisel
to line, and smooth with spokeshave and sand-paper
block&mdash;a piece of pine 3 &times; 2 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches, with the
sand-paper tacked on the <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch edge. Scrape and
sand-paper top.</p>

<p>To fasten this top to the frame, lay the top upside
down on the floor, and set the frame, inverted, on it.
Measure carefully to locate the frame in proper
position, and fasten with four 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  or 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch flat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>head screws. Assuming that all parts of the frame
have been scraped and sand-papered before assembling,
the table is ready for polishing.</p>

<p>Oak is the wood commonly used for this piece
of furniture, but if well seasoned, chestnut is lighter
in weight and just as satisfactory as to grain and
finish. (See <a href="#XLIX">staining and polishing</a>.)</p>

<p>Sometimes in mission furniture the legs of the
table are allowed to come up through the top.
This design is shown at <a href="#fig198">Fig. 198</a>. The diameter
of the top is 24 inches, but the height is increased,
as this is designed as a centre or reading table. On
account of the support furnished by the shoulder
at the top of legs, the top set of rails is omitted, and
the fastening made by four angle irons securely
screwed to the top and legs.</p>

<p>This table, on account of the greater span between
the legs, is as stable as the previous design.
The cross rails are halved, and may be straight or
curved on under side. If desired, a commodious
shelf may be had by fastening a circular piece 19
inches or less in diameter to the top of cross rails.
This will need to be glued up and cut like top piece.

</div>

<p>The square tenon at the top of legs is shown in
the detailed drawing, and care should be taken in
laying out to insure the distance from the shoulder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>to bottom of leg being alike on all four, if the top

</div>

<p>After gluing up and dressing down the top, lay
out circle and two-inch square openings for the
tenons. Test these squares carefully before cutting,
to make sure they are equally
spaced, saw out circle, and finish
as in previous table. Saw out the
squares close to line and finish
with chisel. In putting on angle
irons, screw them to the top first
and press it tightly down on the
shoulders before fastening to legs.
A strong cleat 18 or 20 inches long
fastened to under side of top across
the grain with four or five screws
will help to prevent warping, but is
not absolutely necessary. If the circular
shelf is added, it is to be fastened
to cross rails by screws from
the under side through drilled holes.</p>


<h3>DESIGNING MISSION FURNITURE</h3>

<p>Boys who have followed the preceding instructions
will be able to plan and construct the following
designs without detailed explanations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>The two drawings for plant stands are in the nature
of suggestions, and although taken from pieces actually
made they show the great difference in form
that is possible in meeting the same conditions.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig200"></a><img src="images/fig200.jpg" width="400" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 200. Design for a plant stand</div>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig199">Fig. 199</a> is thoroughly representative of the so-called
mission style
with its mortise and
tenon joints and
straight square legs.</p>

<p>The shelf for holding
the jardini&egrave;re is
indicated by dotted
lines, and it is held by
cleats fastened to the
sides by flat-head
screws.</p>

<p>A dark finish, antique
or rich brown,
is appropriate for
either design. <a href="#fig200">Fig. 200</a>
shows a radically different
form. The shelf
is octagonal or square
with the corners cut at 45 degrees to fit the legs.</p>

<p>The detail view shows the arrangement of lower
rails meeting the legs at the same angle. The ends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>of rails are mitred and secured by wire nails set
below the surface and holes filled. The fastening
between upper shelf and legs may be either round-head
blue screws or dowel pins of the same material
as the legs, with the outer ends slightly rounded.</p>

<p>The shape of the legs makes this design weaker
than <a href="#fig199">Fig. 199</a>, but their spread results in a more
stable base and makes this stand less liable to
upset.</p>

<p>The foot rest (<a href="#fig201">Fig. 201</a>) is to be provided with a
cushion covered with leather nailed on with large-head
craftsman nails.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 201. Foot rest. Fig. 202. Footstool in mission style</div>
</div>

<p>The cushion may be filled with hair, excelsior,
or even fine shavings, securely sewed in a cover of
ticking and held in place by the leather cover.
The leather must be brought down and nailed to
the lower edge of the cross rails. Fasten the top
to cleats screwed on inside of ends.</p>

<p><a href="#fig201">Fig. 202</a> shows the same problem worked out in
straight lines, the leather being nailed to all four
top rails.</p>

<div class="caption"> Figs. 203 and 204. Mission desks. A study in design</div>
</div>

<p>Each of these pieces of furniture suggests a new
one, and chairs, settees, umbrella stands, writing
desks, etc., may be made along the same general lines.</p>

<p>The plant stand (<a href="#fig199">Fig. 199</a>) suggests the umbrella
rack. The shelf is simply shifted from the top to
bottom and provided with a brass tray to catch the
water. Valuable suggestions for such furniture
may be obtained by consulting catalogues of furniture,
and by constant observations of well-made
pieces.</p>

<p>These designs should never be copied, but used
only as aids to the working out of original ideas.</p>

<p>The typical writing desk shown at <a href="#fig203">Fig. 203</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>illustrates this point. While fairly well proportioned,
the legs could well be heavier. The drawer is also
faulty. Its position makes it necessary to move
away from the desk in order to open it. The lower
cross rail will be a nuisance when sitting close
enough to write and other features might be criticised.
Whether your design will be a success
or not depends on the clearness with which all these
details are thought out. <a href="#fig203">Fig. 204</a> shows several
of the above defects corrected.</p>

<h2><a name="XLII" id="XLII">XLII</a><br />
<br />
<small>THE CHEST</small></h2>


<p>This is one of the most convenient and substantial
pieces of furniture about the house.
For the storage of linen, furs, or clothing
it is invaluable. It may be placed in a corner,
and with a liberal supply of sofa cushions makes an
ideal cosey corner and seat.</p>

<p>The construction is purposely strong and heavy,
and calls for good material like quartered oak,
chestnut, walnut, or cedar. The latter wood, especially
<i>red</i> cedar, is light in weight, but attractive
in colour, and has the further advantage of being
moth proof.</p>

<p><a href="#fig205">Fig. 205</a> <i>a</i> shows a well-proportioned chest of
quartered oak. The horizontal rails are mortised
into the heavy legs, and the panels may be arranged
as shown in the detail.</p>

<p>A rabbet is cut on the inner edge of the rails, and
a corresponding groove ploughed in the legs. The
panel may be of one piece, set into the rabbet and
grooves. Its large expanse may be carved, raised,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>or simply polished plain, allowing the natural grain
to furnish the ornamentation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig205"></a><img src="images/fig205.jpg" width="600" height="581" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 205. The linen chest</div>

</div>

<p>The legs may be plain, as shown, or curved slightly
at the bottom, as suggested in the detail. The top
is too large to be made in one piece, and it should be
built up like a table top, and hinged to upper back
rail by strong iron or brass ornamental hinges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>If finished in a dark colour with dull surface, the
metal corner plates and escutcheon will greatly
enhance its appearance.</p>

<p>These may be made out of sheet brass. First
lay out the design on paper. Cut out to the outline,
and trace upon the surface of the sheet metal. A
metal-cutting saw blade obtained from the hardware
store can be fitted into the frame of the coping saw.</p>

<p>With this tool, saw on the lines exactly as in
thin wood, and file the edges smooth. The holes for
the heavy nails are drilled. If suitable big-headed
nails cannot be found, brass screws may be used,
and when in position, the heads filed to any desired
shape.</p>

<p>An ancient green effect can be produced on such
brass ornaments by painting with ammonia.</p>

<p>The cover of a large chest like this will need to be
reinforced by strong cleats on the under side across
the grain. They should be 3 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches, just long
enough to allow the cover to close readily, and should
be secured by five or six screws on each cleat.</p>

<p>The bottom may be pine or white wood, secured
by nails or screws to <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch square cleats screwed
on the inside of ends and sides. A chest of better
proportion, but slightly more complicated in construction,
is shown at <i>b</i>. Here the front is broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>up into three panels, and a better space arrangement
secured. The whole front in this case may be put
together with mortise and tenon joints, as in panel
door construction, or the simpler method just
described may be used. The mortise and tenon
form is the better way, and as usual takes more time.</p>

<p>Carved panels suggest a very rich and valuable
piece of furniture, but they are not necessary, as a
good flat polish showing the natural grain of the
wood is very satisfactory.</p>

<br />
<small>THE DRAWING OUTFIT</small></h2>


<p>An equipment for mechanical drawing, except
the instruments, can be easily made
in the shop by any boy who has had some
practice with tools.</p>

<p>The drawing board is the first thing needed, and
several makes are in use, the object of all of them
being to insure a true flat surface by overcoming
the natural tendency of wood to warp.</p>

<p>Shrinkage will take place in spite of all precautions,
but this is not a serious matter, and does not
affect the usefulness of the board.</p>

<p>All boards, it is conceded, should be "built up,"
rather than consist of one piece. The idea is that
the warping of one piece is somewhat counteracted
by that of the adjoining pieces in other
directions.</p>

<p><a href="#fig206">Fig. 206</a> shows three forms in common use. At
<i>a</i> the ends are united to wide cleats by a tongue and
groove joint.</p>

<p>In shrinking and expanding with weather changes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>the board is free to slide along the joint, being glued
only at the centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig206"></a><img src="images/fig206.jpg" width="600" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 206. The drawing board</div>

</div>

<p>At <i>b</i> two dovetail-shaped strips are inserted on
the under side across the grain. This is more difficult
cult to make on account of the shape of the
groove, but it is otherwise satisfactory. At <i>c</i> two
strong cleats are fastened across the under side by
screws. This is the easiest and least satisfactory
method, as the cleats are often in the way, making
the board clumsy, and furthermore it does not
allow for shrinkage, unless the screws are secured
in grooves instead of in plain holes.</p>

<p>A good proportion for a small board is 24 &times; 18
inches. If the first method of construction is decided
on, glue up four or five strips of well seasoned white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>pine, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch thick, of the width desired, and four
inches shorter than the final length of board. Place
in clamps for twenty-four hours, and when dry dress
down perfectly true to a thickness of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch.
Test for warp and wind, and square the ends.</p>

<p>Square up two pieces of stock 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches wide,
with a length equal to width of board. For the
tongue and groove joint, a set of tongue and grooving
planes will be necessary. Two cutters for this
purpose come with the modern universal plane,
and if available this may be used. In either case,
set the depth gauge at half an inch, and plow a
groove on one edge of each strip <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch wide to the
full depth, as shown at <i>d</i>. On both ends of the board,
plane the tongue same size as groove at <i>e</i>. Coat
the tongue at each end of board with glue for a distance
of six or eight inches at the centre, fit the end
strips in position, and place in clamps over night.
When dry, give the surface a final truing up, and also
the ends, as the clamps may have made a slight
change.</p>

<p>Go all over the surface with a sand-paper block,
using 00 sand-paper, and shellac the board all over.
When dry rub flat with the sand-paper block. Make
a final test for any possible inaccuracy, and the
board is ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>T square and triangles may be made, but as
rubber or celluloid triangles are better in some ways
than wood, the former are recommended.</p>

<p>The T square is a very pretty little problem in
woodwork, and may be made as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig207"></a><img src="images/fig207.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 207. T square and triangles</div>

</div>

<p>The design for the head may be either <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>
(<a href="#fig207">Fig. 207</a>), a being simply a rectangular piece of hard
wood, with two rounded corners; <i>b</i> is laid out as
shown, sawed near the line and curved side finished
with spokeshave. The straight side should be
<i>perfectly</i> straight, as any variation will give horizontal
lines out of parallel.</p>

<p>The blade may be of one piece, or built up. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>very satisfactory combination is to make the head
of black walnut, and the blade of hard maple, with
black walnut edges. It will pay to make a special
shooting board for this work, and to make several T
squares at the same time. This shooting board should
be slightly longer than the blade. (See <a href="#fig206">Fig. 206</a>.)</p>

<p>Gauge a line at a distance <i>x</i> from the edge, equal
to the width of 2 inches, and tack a straight strip
of wood up to this line as a guide. When the blade
has been planed to its thickness of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch, it is to
be placed in space <i>x</i> and planed to width.</p>

<p>To plane a piece of hard wood down to an eighth
of an inch, tack it to a pine board with three 1-inch
brads. The location of these brads can be such that
only one hole will be left in the blade to be filled
up afterward. One should be in the position of
the central screw over the head, the second at the
point where hole <i>h</i> is to be bored, the third at about
the centre of the blade. Set these brads slightly
below the surface, and dress down smooth.</p>

<p>When tested and found true, lift the blade by
inserting a knife blade under it, again fasten to the
board with unfinished side up, and again dress down.
Before removing from the board, lay out the curved
end to correspond with the curve of the head, and
cut to line with a chisel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>Remove from board, finish curved end with sand-paper
block. Bore hole <i>h</i> for hanging up, locate
holes for screws, and drill just large enough to allow
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch round-head brass or blued screws to
pass through. In attaching the head, make sure
that the two parts are at right angles, and use thin
copper burrs or washers under the screw heads.</p>

<p>If the blade is to have edges of a different colour,
joint the maple on shooting board, and glue the
strips to it, before planing to thickness. This
should be done on a flat board, with paper between
it and the blade. Glue the three pieces together,
and drive 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brads up close to and touching
the outside strips, at intervals of four inches. By
bending these slightly over the blade, considerable
pressure will be obtained, tending to keep the pieces
together while glue is hardening.</p>

<p>Then proceed to dress down, and true up as before.
When the process is once learned, considerable
pin money may be made by disposing of the
squares, and that will help to buy material for other
things.</p>

<p>Triangles made from single pieces of wood are
absolutely unreliable. Referring to <a href="#fig207">Fig. 207</a>, the
45-degree triangle shows the grain running up and
down. As shrinkage takes place <i>m</i> will not change,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>but <i>n</i> will, and this will alter the angles; and besides
a piece of thin wood this size will warp and make
the triangle useless for mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>The 30-60 triangle illustrates the usual method
of constructing a wooden triangle.</p>

<p>Aside from bisecting the 90, 60, and 30 degree
angles to get the mitres, these joints, if simply
glued, will be too weak for practical use. The edge
view and dotted lines indicate a thin feather of
wood glued into a saw cut made through the edge
of each corner, the usual method of strengthening.
It is a delicate operation, and is only recommended
to boys who are fond of fine work.</p>

<p>A very serviceable section liner may be made
from a wooden triangle by carefully cutting out of
one side a rectangular opening, as shown in the detail.
Make a piece of thin wood to fit this space, but <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
shorter, and fitted so as to move freely. By
moving this block and the triangle, alternately,
vertical or oblique lines can be drawn for sectioning,
and they will be equally spaced. Other blocks
varying in length will give a variety of spacings.</p>

<p>It is possibly one of the cheapest section liners,
and the most satisfactory within the means of any
one. Irregular or French curves may be made in
thin wood. They should be drawn on the surface,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>sawed out with the coping saw, and sand-papered
smooth. As their thickness should be but a trifle
over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch, they are very frail and easily broken.
These curves can be easily made in sheet aluminum,
and they will be much more satisfactory. This
metal is handled similarly to thin wood, except that
the saw must be a metal cutting blade.</p>

<p>Triangles may be made of the same material.
Lay out the form with a sharp steel point or scriber,
saw as close to lines as possible, and with a fine file
finish to line. Then smooth the curves with fine
emery paper wrapped around a lead pencil. To
make straight edges, as on triangles, lay a sheet of
emery cloth on bench, and rub triangle back and forth.</p>


<h3>THE PANTAGRAPH</h3>

<p>For copying designs, for reducing or enlarging,
this old-fashioned instrument may be easily constructed.
<a href="#fig208">Fig. 208</a> shows it made of four strips of
thin wood of equal length. Either pine or white
wood will answer. The pieces have to be squared,
twenty-five inches long, three quarters of an inch
wide, and a quarter inch thick.</p>

<p>Bore or drill through the four pieces held in a
vise, and space the holes shown in drawing three
inches apart, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch in size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig208"></a><img src="images/fig208.jpg" width="600" height="482" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 208. The pantagraph</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>When put together, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> should be in line.
Point <i>a</i> is to remain fixed, the pantagraph being free
to move around it as a pivot. To accomplish this,
cut out a block, as shown at <i>x</i>, with a hole drilled
at the centre for pivot, and two others for screwing
to the drawing table or board.</p>

<p>The pin for this pivot may be a thick flat-head
wire nail, screw, or even a screw eye. The joints
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i> are also pivots moving with the pantagraph.
They may consist of thumb screws, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>nuts, or screw eyes, and must move freely, yet
without play.</p>

<p>Points <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are to be interchangeable, one
having a tracing point, the other a pencil.</p>

<p>The tracing point may be a wire nail, rivet, or
screw, with the point filed sharp, and then slightly
rounded. The pencil point should be a piece of
lead pencil, whittled down to such a size as to pass
through the hole at <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, and make a snug fit.</p>

<p>To enlarge a design, place tracing point at <i>b</i>,
and fasten original design under it to drawing board
with thumb tacks.</p>

<p>Under <i>c</i> fasten a sheet of drawing paper. With
the right hand at <i>b</i>, trace the design by carefully
sliding tracing point along the lines. At the same
time, with the left hand keep pencil point at <i>c</i>
sufficiently in contact with the paper to make a
clear line.</p>

<p>To reduce a drawing, reverse <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, bringing
pencil point and paper to <i>b</i>, and original to <i>c</i>. Pass
tracer over design at <i>c</i>, and the reduced design will
be traced at <i>b</i>. Different proportions between
original and reproduction may be obtained by shifting
the position of pivots <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig208">Fig. 208</a> shows pivot e shifted to position <i>h</i>. As
distance <i>c e</i> should always equal distance <i>d f</i>, it now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>becomes necessary to move pivot <i>f</i> to point <i>g</i>. By
remembering this rule, and placing pivots in various
positions, a wide range of proportions is possible.</p>


<h3>THE DRAWING TABLE</h3>

<p>A table to hold the drawing board should be not
less than 3 feet 2 inches high, as much of the work
is performed standing up. A stool with revolving
seat should be provided for the draughtsman to sit
on occasionally.</p>

<p>The table top may be made slanting, but it is
better practice to have a heavy flat top of pine, which
may be used as a large drawing board itself, and to
provide for the slant by using a triangular block
under the farther end of drawing board. Two or
three blocks may be made, about two feet long and
of different sizes, to give different degrees of slant.</p>

<p>Tables for this purpose are often made with tops,
which may be adjusted at different angles, and the
young designer may try his inventive talent in this
large field, but any arrangement which will bring
an element of instability is to be studiously avoided.
The drawing table should be as solid and rigid
as possible.</p>

<p>The design in <a href="#fig209">Fig. 209</a> was made by our boys, and
has proved very satisfactory. It has much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>mission style about it, with its square legs and
mortised joints.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 209. Drawer for table and table for mechanical drawing</div>

</div>

<p>After the description of mission furniture construction
in previous chapters, only a few points in
the construction need be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>The board <i>a</i>, used as a foot rest, is necessary
when sitting at the table on account of its height,
and it also ties the frame together in the front. The
cross rail <i>b</i> acts in the same capacity at the back.</p>

<p>The heavy pine top is "built up" like a drawing
board of several pieces, and supported by two cleats
3 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches across the grain underneath. It may
be attached to the frame by any one of the methods
described under mission furniture, and its left-hand
edge should be as true as that of the drawing board.</p>

<p>If an especially accurate edge is desired, a piece
of iron 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch, planed straight by a machinist,
may be let into this edge, as shown in the drawing,
and secured by flat-head screws through holes
drilled and countersunk. This arrangement is seldom
seen, but it is well worth the added cost.</p>

<p>The table shown is provided with a generous-sized
drawer. This may be omitted, but is a great
convenience for keeping plans and sketches. Its
construction is shown in detail. The sides and
front have a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch groove, ploughed to receive
the bottom, and at the back end a vertical groove
is cut to hold the back piece which is dadoed to fit.</p>

<p>At the top of each side is nailed a strip <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch
square. These cleats are to retain the strips <i>s</i>.
Make these strips <i>s</i> of hard wood, preferably ash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>and about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch longer than the width of drawer,
measured inside.</p>

<p>By placing the strips on top of drawings obliquely,
and then straightening them across the drawer,
they bind against the sides, and keep drawings down
flat. The cleats at top of drawer prevent them from
escaping at the top, especially when it becomes nearly
full.</p>

<p>The extra front on the drawer with rounded
edges covers up the joints around front of box, and is
a purely ornamental feature. If this is used, secure
to real front by flat-head screws from the inside.</p>

<p>The box which holds the drawers is to be secured
to the legs by screws countersunk. Many modifications
of this table will occur to the woodworker, such
as additional drawers, but it must be kept in mind
that comfortable knee room is essential, and the
space on under side of the top is largely to be
reserved for this important purpose.</p>

<p>A box for holding instruments has been described
in another chapter, and triangles, rules, etc., may
be kept in it.</p>

<p>The T square should be hung on a hook at either
end of table, to overcome any tendency the thin
blade may have to twist or warp, the weight of the
head helping to draw it out straight.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>All drawings should have a neat title, and a
number. To work out a system of numbering so that
any drawing may be found quickly
is a good job for a rainy day.</p>

<p>A good filing cabinet for plans
is suggested in <a href="#fig210">Fig. 210</a>. Dimensions
are not given, as they will
depend on the size of drawing
paper used. A uniform-sized sheet
should be adopted at the start,
and the drawings scaled to accommodate
this size of paper.</p>

<p>The shelves should be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch thick, and gained
into sides as shown. A clear space of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches
between the shelves will be ample, and a semicircular
curve should be cut in the front. The
depth of cabinet should not be over half an inch
more than the width of the sheets.</p>

<p>A top and mitred base are shown, and the space
between should be closed by a panelled door to keep
out dust.</p>

<p>A cabinet of this style should not be less than
thirty inches high, and if the whole space is not
required for drawings, the lower part may be changed
and fitted with drawers for models, specimens, and
other treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>For boys who are interested in collecting, whether
minerals, butterflies, or other things, such a cabinet
may be made entirely of drawers, and the panelled
door omitted.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 211. Drawer construction</div>

</div>

<p>For the safe keeping of butterflies, moths, and
other insects, an eminent scientist has recommended
a drawer construction as shown at <a href="#fig211">Fig. 211</a>. This
detail shows a section at the front, with the bottom
piece gained into a groove. The bottom of the
drawer is covered with a
layer of sheet cork, and
over it oiled paper. The
upper part of box is not
fastened, but is slipped
down inside strips <i>s</i>, which have rounded tops, and
extend around the four sides.</p>

<p>The upper half is grooved to receive a sheet of
glass, which is held in place by a small cleat. By
this method the drawer is covered while the specimens
are visible, and dampness is kept out. The
cork bottom is to receive the pins, and the specimens
may be reached by simply taking out the top. The
dimensions recommended for the drawer are 22 &times;
16 &times; 2 inches, outside measurements, and if a number
are to be used, the spaces between the shelves of
the cabinet should correspond with these figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>A quaint conceit sometimes used by enthusiastic
collectors is to make their boxes in the form of
books, as shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig212">Fig. 212</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig212"></a><img src="images/fig212.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 212. Book shaped boxes</div>

</div>

<p>The outside has the shape of a book, the two
halves being fitted by tongue and groove joint.
This keeps out moisture, the great enemy of dried
specimens, and when a number of these boxes,
properly coloured and labelled, are piled on a shelf,
they have the appearance of so many large volumes.</p>

<p>This unique idea may be used in other ways. A
very pretty illustration is a stamp box for the writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>desk, made up in the form of a book, which apparently
has a silk ribbon for a book mark. This ribbon
is the handle of a little drawer, which pulls out, disclosing
the contents. The arrangement is shown
at <i>b</i>. The idea may be carried still farther by
having half a dozen of these small volumes in a book
rack, the labels reading&mdash;"rubber bands," "pens,"
"stamps," etc. All should be stained a uniform
colour, and the illusion may be carried still farther
by gilding the parts which represent the edges of
the leaves.</p>

<br />
<small>WOODWORK FOR OUTDOOR SPORTS</small></h2>


<h3>THE TENNIS COURT</h3>

<p>The young woodworker is especially well
fitted for the preparation of a tennis court.
He has learned the value of accurate
measurements, and is accustomed to make a neat
and finished job. While the making of a court
seems a simple proposition, it may be a very expensive
one, if help has to be hired, and all the equipment
bought ready for use.</p>

<p>The first step is to select the exact location, which
should either be level or practically so. Any discussion
as to the merits of dirt or sod courts must
be left to the reader. The court proper is 78 &times; 36
feet, the posts for the tennis net being three feet
outside on either side, and the space at the ends
between the court and stop nets fifteen to twenty
feet more, making a total length of 118 feet.</p>

<p>The following method of laying out the court is
recommended:</p>

<p>Make sure that the long way is exactly north and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>south, and drive in the ground a wooden stake at
northeast corner A (<a href="#fig213">Fig. 213</a>). At B, directly west,
drive stake 36 feet from A. A steel tape measure is
by far the best thing to use for laying out, as cord
stretches and leads to inaccuracies, and two tapes
are better than one.</p>

<p>At the centre of each stake drive a strong nail.
From B measure 78 feet south, and place a temporary
stake. To insure the angle being 90 degrees, apply
this test: From B along the line laid out last,
measure 48 feet: slip the ring of the tape measure
over the nail at A, and measure to this new point.
If the angle is 90 degrees, this diagonal measurement
should be 60 feet. If this measurement does not
come right, shift the stake C, until this oblique line
is exactly 60 feet, then lines A-B and B-C are at
right angles. Having fixed this angle, again measure
from B to C, and drive stake C at 78 feet from B.</p>

<p>Locate stake D 78 feet from A, and 36 feet from C.
A final test should now be made by measuring the
diagonals B-D and A-C. They should be exactly
alike. These corner stakes may now be driven in
flush with the surface, and they should be allowed
to remain, to avoid the necessity of doing the work
all over again later in the season when the lines become
obscure. Measure in from each stake 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  feet for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>the alleys and drive stakes in flush.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig213"></a><img src="images/fig213.jpg" width="600" height="932" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 213. The tennis court</div>

</div>

<p>Next measure from stakes <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i> 18 feet along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>outside lines, and again drive in stakes <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>.
By passing a cord from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, the
service lines are laid out, omitting alleys. Find
centre of service lines, and connect points <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.
The net crosses the centre of court from east to
west, extending three feet beyond on each side. At
these two points <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, set the posts in the ground.
By this method, the only stakes left in the ground
are on the outside lines, and they must be driven in
so that under no circumstances will a player stumble
over them. They can always be found after a rain
storm, and new lines laid out.</p>

<p>The posts for the net should be seven feet long
and four inches square. Plane them off smooth, and
coat the end which is to be in the ground with creosote
or coal tar.</p>

<p>This coating should extend three feet six inches
from the bottom, and as the post is to be three feet
in the ground, this coating will extend six inches
above. Decay takes place at the point of contact
with the ground, and the creosote will prolong the
life of the posts for many years, if the wood is well
seasoned. Many posts for tennis nets are not
sunk fully three feet in the ground, and consequently
require guy ropes or wires to keep them
upright. The time spent in digging the holes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>tamping the dirt around posts is well spent, as the
pull on them is severe, and they must stand
upright.</p>

<p>Six inches from the top, bore a hole <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch
in diameter, east and west. The net must be three
feet high at its centre, and three feet six inches at
the posts. Pass the rope through these holes, and
make fast to a cleat. These cleats may be of iron
or wood, a sketch of a wooden cleat being shown at
<a href="#fig215">Fig. 215</a>. They should be of oak or other hard wood,
put on with two strong screws through holes which
have been bored and countersunk. On the side
of post toward the net, three strong screw eyes
should be put about a foot apart, the lower one six
inches from the ground. The net is to be fastened
to these screw eyes to keep it in position. When
everything is ready, paint the posts two coats of
dark or bronze green.</p>

<p>The position of the tall poles for the back stop
are shown in <a href="#fig213">Fig. 213</a>. Fifteen feet is none too far
from the court for the stop net, and twenty would
be better. Purchase twelve foot four by fours,
and plane smooth, or have them dressed at the
mill when ordering. This will reduce them to
3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inches. The method of enclosing the whole
court by wire netting is seldom resorted to, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>the space available is very limited. The method
here suggested of bringing the ends about at an
angle of 45 degrees has been found very satisfactory
in stopping swift service. Locate the post holes
12 feet apart, and dig them three feet deep. After
treating the lower ends of posts for three and a half
feet with creosote or tar, place in the ground, plumb
each one while filling in, and tamp the earth about
them firmly.</p>

<p>Strips 1 &times; 3 inches and 12 feet long must be
used to join the posts at the top, else the pull necessary
to straighten the wire will bring them out of
plumb. These strips are to be nailed at the
extreme top by eight-penny wire nails. When
the structure is finished, except for the wire,
paint with two coats of the same colour as the
net posts.</p>

<p>The wire netting is chicken wire, inch and a half
mesh, and three feet wide. Three of these strips
will cover the space from the ground to the top.
It is put on with staples nailed to the posts, stretched
taut, and the joints where the strips touch wired
together at intervals of three feet with soft iron
wire.</p>

<p>If arranged as shown in the drawing, it will take
six strips sixty feet long by three wide for the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>stop, or 1080 square feet, and will cost $9 or $10.</p>

<p>Cheap cotton back stops are sold, but they are not
very satisfactory, as they tighten in damp and sag
in dry weather. For a permanent court belonging
to a club the galvanized wire is well worth the
difference in cost.</p>

<p>The size of the mesh is important, because although
a tennis ball is 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches in diameter, when
driven hard it frequently goes through two-inch mesh.</p>

<p>There are many opportunities about the tennis
court for the young woodworker to show his skill.
Camp stools, settees, benches either plain or rustic,
a chest to keep racquets and balls, fitted with a
strong padlock, shelters for the spectators or club
members, and even a small club house are among
the possibilities.</p>

<p>Permanent structures, such as shelters and heavy
benches, should generally be on the west side of
the court, as spectators are usually present after
the sun has passed the meridian, and it will then
be at their back.</p>


<h3><a id="TCA"></a>Tennis Court Accessories<br />
<br />THE CAMP-STOOL</h3>

<p>Use hard wood such as maple, ash, or oak. The
stock required for each stool will be four pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>20<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1 inches, two pieces 14 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
inches, and two pieces 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig214"></a><img src="images/fig214.jpg" width="600" height="416" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 214. The camp-stool</div>
</div>

<p>The four legs are made as shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig214">Fig. 214</a>).
The small end is to be rounded to a diameter of
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch; 8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches from this end a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole
is bored for the rivet or bolt, which is to hold the
legs together. Seven inches from the lower or
foot end a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch hole is bored <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  or <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch
deep. This is to receive the cross rod or dowel.
The two top pieces 14 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches are rounded
on two of their edges as shown at <i>b</i>. On the flat
side of one of these bore two holes <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch diameter
and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch deep, 9 inches apart, to receive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>small end of the leg. On the other top piece, the
holes are eleven inches apart.</p>

<p>The two cross pieces may be rounded, or pieces
of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch maple dowel used. In either case, the
ends must be pared down to a diameter of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch
to fit the holes of this size. One is to be sawed nine
inches long, the other eleven.</p>

<p>The camp-stool is composed of two frames pivoted
together. Put together the inner frame, first gluing
the legs into holes bored in top pieces, and at the
same time gluing in the cross piece. These joints
may be fastened by driving a brad through from the
outside, or by wedges, as described in previous
chapters. The outer frame is now put together,
and the two pivoted. This is usually done with a
rivet, a thin washer having been placed between
the two sets of legs to relieve the friction. A small
bolt and nut may be used, but as the nut is liable
to come off, the bolt end should be riveted over the
nut with the hammer.</p>

<p>Canvas or even a piece of carpet may be used
for the seat. The size required is 15 by 12, the ends
being tacked to the lower side of the top pieces.
When canvas is used, it is usually turned under an
inch on each side, and hemmed. In this case, its
width must be at least fourteen inches. All articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>which are to be handled much should have the edges
slightly rounded; this rule applies to the camp-stool.</p>


<h3>BENCHES</h3>

<p>Folding settees for outdoor use are on the market
at very cheap prices, but they are neither comfortable
nor substantial. Fixed benches can be made
of heavy but simple construction, as well as movable
ones.</p>

<p><a href="#fig215">Fig. 215</a> shows the simplest possible form. Posts
of locust, chestnut, or cedar are set in the ground
to a depth of two feet or more. The diameter
should be at least four inches.</p>

<p>A space one inch by three should be sawed out of
each, as a rest for the cross pieces. These should
be two by four stock, ten inches long, and must
be securely nailed to the posts by eight or ten
penny nails. The seat should be 16 inches or 18
inches above the ground, made of heavy plank at
least two inches thick and 14 inches wide. Bore
quarter-inch holes, countersink and fasten the top
to cross pieces by three-inch flat-head screws. The
span between cross pieces should not be over five
feet, four would be better, so that a bench twelve
feet long would call for six posts and three cross
pieces, besides the top. Space the posts five feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>apart between centres. This will allow an overhang
of one foot at each end. The seat should be planed
smooth, edges slightly rounded, and then two coats
of boiled linseed oil applied. Painting seats is
not advised, and varnish for outside work is seldom
satisfactory. The wood for the top should be of
some kind that is free from pitch, as the sun will
draw it out, and a sticky seat result. Oak or maple
will be very satisfactory.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>A movable settee of heavy construction is suggested
in <a href="#fig216">Fig. 216</a>. The main dimensions for the
standards supporting the seat and back strips are
given, but the form may be modified to suit the
young designer. There is considerable waste in
making standards of this sort, and it is important
to have the grain run in the direction indicated in
the drawing. The two strips for the back, as well
as the seat, should be put on with screws. The
horizontal pieces on this settee will not give the
necessary rigidity lengthwise, and it will be important
to add braces under the seat. These may be in
the form of heavy angle irons or square blocks,
as shown at <i>a</i>. These blocks should be two inches
square, and fastened with three-inch screws to both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>seat and standard. Everything about this settee
is heavy and substantial, as all outdoor work should
be. The camp-stool furnishes all the light furniture
necessary.</p>

<p>The standards should never be more than four
feet apart, so that a settee in this style, eight feet
long, would require three standards.</p>

<p>This design can be changed to a simple bench
by omitting the back and sawing the standard on
its back edge to the same outline as the front, as
suggested by the dotted line. The trefoil opening
is made by boring three holes with a large bit at
the points of a triangle.</p>

<p>The covered seat shown at <a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a> is one that
may be constructed as shown, or modified in size,
proportions, etc.</p>

<p>Small as it is, it will tax the skill of the young
worker, and give him many of the problems of outdoor
construction to figure out. It includes the
setting and levelling of posts, framing, roofing,
flooring, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 217. A covered seat</div>

</div>

<p>The material necessary should be first carefully
estimated, with allowance made for waste. This
is an item often forgotten by the amateur, and one
especially to be provided for in framing. If the
dimensions are to vary from those shown in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>sketch, it would be wise to make a careful drawing
first. In all outdoor structures, wind, rain, snow,
and the effect of strong sunlight must be considered.</p>

<p>As this shelter is primarily for a tennis court, the
timbers for the frame should be planed by hand or
dressed at the mill, when purchased.</p>

<p>The 4 &times; 4 uprights should be bought 12 feet long,
as this is a standard size, and set into the ground
deep enough to bring the top nine feet above ground.
The temptation to place posts only a little way in
the ground must be overcome. The roof should be
counted on to withstand a wind pressure of sixty miles
an hour, and three feet in the ground is necessary in
this case, as there are no braces to help support it.</p>

<p>Having cut the mortises for the horizontal tie
piece <i>a</i>, place the first post in the hole dug for it,
tamp the earth around it, and plumb with "level
and plumb."</p>

<p>Another method would be to lay both uprights
on the ground, place the tie piece in position, fasten
with wooden pins driven through holes bored
through the mortise and tenon joints, and nail
the 2 &times; 4 plate on top of both posts. Then raise
the structure, and place both posts in their respective
holes at the same time.

<p>In any work of this character, two boys should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>work together, and two trestles or saw horses will
be a necessary part of their equipment. In mortise
and tenon joints of this character a method called
draw boring is frequently used. (See <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig217b">Fig. 217<i>b</i></a>.)</p>

<p>The hole for the pin or dowel is first bored across
the centre of the mortise. The tenon is inserted
snugly, and the bit again inserted until it makes
a mark on the tenon. The tenon is withdrawn,
and the centre of bit placed <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>  inch nearer the
shoulder than the mark made, and the hole bored.
This brings the distance <i>y</i> slightly less than <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>The three holes through which the pin is to pass
are not in line when the tenon is again placed in
mortise. The result is to draw the tenon tight,
when the pin is driven home, and to make the joint
a very snug one, as it should be.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 217b. Draw boring a joint and method of levelling posts</div>
</div>

<p>If this method of constructing the frame on the
ground is not used, the tie piece must be placed in
position before the second post is set. Fasten the
joints with the pins, and level the tie piece. If
the two posts have been laid out together on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>trestles, their tops must now come level and true.</p>

<p>This first step in making the structure is extremely
important, as the success of the following work
depends on it.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 218. Details of roof construction and forms of rafters</div>

</div>

<p>After tamping the uprights solidly, the corner
posts for supporting the floor may be set in the
ground. They should be of locust, cedar, or chestnut,
and at least four inches in diameter. Set them
in the ground not less than thirty inches, and flush
with the ground line. It will be better to dig out
three or four inches of top soil from the whole area,
and afterward fill in with gravel, as this does not
hold the moisture. This precaution will help
to prevent decay, and, wherever possible, all the
parts in contact with the earth should be painted
with creosote. The outside of posts should be five
feet one way and four feet eight inches the other.
Their tops should be sawed off level. This may be
done after setting. Saw one post at the desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>height. To level the others with it, rest a straight
board on first post, and while one boy holds the
level on its upper edge, let the other make a pencil
mark on the next post along under side of the board.
Saw to this line, and level the remaining posts in
the same manner. (<a href="#fig217b">Fig. 217<i>b</i></a>.)</p>

<p>The sill or frame for flooring must now be prepared.
Use either 2 &times; 6 or 2 &times; 4 inch spruce. Cut
two pieces five feet long, and two pieces four feet
eight inches. Lay out half lap joints at the ends,
and saw to the lines.</p>

<p>Spike this frame to the locust posts, and as it
touches the outside of the uprights, nail to the latter,
with ten-penny wire nails.</p>

<p>As additional support will be needed for the flooring,
cut two 2 &times; 4, and fasten them across the frame
either by half lap joint or spikes.</p>

<p>If this frame is planed on the outside, no finishing
strip will be needed, but if it is rough sawed stock,
a facing strip of 1 &times; 4 inch material should be placed
on the outside, flush with the top of the frame.</p>

<p>The flooring may now be laid, using tongue and
groove stock, and allowing it to project an inch beyond
the frame on all four sides. The edges of this
projection should be rounded with the plane. The
flooring should be neatly fitted around the uprights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>so that the latter may appear to come up through
a solid floor 5 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 0 inches.</p>

<p>The roof should be made next, leaving the construction
of the seat to the last. The roof timbers
consist of six rafters four feet long, and six braces
two feet one and a half inches long. Two methods
are shown, and several combinations may be used.
The rafters may have square ends, or some simple
curved design may be sawed out, as suggested in the
detailed drawing. (<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>.)</p>

<p>The braces may meet the rafters in a plain butt
joint, and be nailed, or they may be gained into the
rafters, as shown in side view. This latter method
makes a neat job, but it is not necessary, as far as
strength is concerned. Nails are used in either case.</p>

<p>The straight rafter is of course the simpler and
easier way, but the Japanese effect produced by a
slight curve at the ends on the upper side is worth
the little additional labour that it requires.</p>

<p>To secure this curve, saw out a template in white
pine about fifteen inches long and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches wide,
at one end, as shown in detail. The curve may be
first drawn in pencil, and then sawed on the line.</p>

<p>From this template lay out six pieces of scrap, 2 &times; 4,
and saw them all out the same size and shape. Nail
them to the lower ends of the rafters on their top side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>The upper ends of the rafters are to be mitred, and
the V-shaped notch cut as shown in detail drawing.
(<a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>.)</p>

<p>The braces are square at one end, and mitred at
the other.</p>

<p>Nail two rafters together at their mitred ends,
using ten or twelve penny wire nails. Place in
position over plate, and nail to it. Nail mitred end
of braces to the upright, and then to rafter. The
method of fastening two joints at right angles is
called toe-nailing&mdash;nailing obliquely&mdash;as shown in
detail.</p>

<p>The braces for middle rafters are fastened to the
tie piece, and will need to be somewhat longer than
the four fastened to the uprights. Their exact length
should be determined by measurement, after the
end rafters are secured. The end sawed off should
be the square end, measurements being made from
the extreme point of the mitred corner.</p>

<p>The roof is to be shingled. For this purpose,
shingle lath, a standard commercial article, is to
be nailed to the rafters at intervals of 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  or 6
inches. For a steep roof like this, 6 inches will
answer. This lath is to project beyond the outside
rafters 9 inches or 1 foot. There must be a shingle
lath at the top of each rafter, no matter how near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>the next one may come, and sometimes the whole
roof is covered with boards as a support for the
shingles, instead of lath.</p>

<p>Begin shingling at the lower end of the rafters,
allowing the first course to project an inch beyond
the first lath. To insure the end of the roof being
straight, it is best to saw the lath after it is nailed
to rafters.</p>

<p>The first course of shingles should be double&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
one over the other, joints broken.</p>

<p>On good and permanent roofs, where the pitch
is not as great as in this case, the method shown at
<i>a</i> (<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>) is frequently used. After the first
course is laid, the second is begun with a third of
a shingle, the next with two thirds, the next with a
whole one. It makes a tighter roof than that in
which each joint comes over the centre of the one
below. The carpenter marks the courses after the
first with a chalk line. Measure up six inches from
the lower edge, at each end of the roof. Take a
piece of mason's line or strong cord, rub it with a
piece of chalk, hold it taut at the two pencil marks,
pull it up in the centre, and allow it to snap back to
the roof. It will leave a straight chalk line from end
to end, and the lower edge of the next course of
shingles is laid to this line. Two shingle nails are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>to be used on each shingle, driven into the shingle
lath high enough up to be covered by the next course.</p>

<p>On very fine work, the edges of shingles where
they touch are first planed, but for ordinary purposes
this is not necessary.</p>

<p>Shingle one side of the roof clear up to the ridge,
allowing the last course to present six inches or so
to the weather. Saw off carefully all that part which
projects, close to the ridge. This will allow the
shingles from the second side to project over those
of the first, and when the second side is finished
it is to be sawed off at the ridge as before.</p>

<p>To protect the ridge from leaks, saddle boards are
sometimes added. These are strips of pine lapped
over the top and nailed, as shown in detailed drawing.</p>

<p>If the curved rafters are used, the pull of the nails
will make the shingles conform to the curve, unless
it is excessive.</p>

<p>Many methods are used by carpenters in finishing
roofs, and considerable time and material are used
in constructing cornices. In this simple structure,
if the timbers have been planed as suggested, it
will be well to leave it as it is, with the rafters
exposed, especially if the ornamental curves have
been sawed before erection. If the roof has been
made with boards, instead of shingle laths, the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>construction is honestly and frankly visible. The
old-fashioned method of putting on "gingerbread"
work, ornaments sawed on a hand or jig-saw, is to
be condemned. Let all your construction be strong,
simple, and straightforward.</p>

<p>Shingles are sometimes stained or painted.
Staining is by far the better treatment, but the
shingles should be dipped into the stain and dried before
they are put on. The stains sold by most paint
stores come in a variety of colours. Some shade
of green, red, or brown should be selected, according
to the colour of the body of the structure. A red
roof on a white structure looks well, as it is usually
seen against a background of blue sky and green
foliage. A light gray building with white trimmings
and red roof makes a pleasing combination.</p>

<p>It only remains to construct the seat. This is
made double, with a back between the uprights,
and the seat cover is hinged to make a chest
below for racquets, etc. This double seat is designed
to give the greatest possible seating accommodation
for this size of shelter. It has the disadvantage of
one seat facing the wrong way, and if the structure
is made longer it is suggested that the back
seat be omitted.</p>

<p>Construct a box without top or bottom 34 inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>by 3 feet 8 inches. The material may be the same
as the floor, but in any case it must be tongue and
groove matched boards. This box will just slip in
between the uprights and must be securely nailed
to them. To fasten to the floor, nail cleats to the
latter just inside the box, and nail the sides and ends
of the box to these cleats. Further to strengthen
the box, square cleats should be nailed upright in
each corner of the inside.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/p451.jpg" width="600" height="460" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 218a. Box seat</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>The backbone of the box is a piece of 2 &times; 4
spruce. Its length will be the distance between
the uprights or the length of the box. Saw down
through the box ends exactly 2 inches, with the
saw against the uprights, and remove the piece 4 &times;
2 from each end. Into these two spaces slip the
2 &times; 4 and toenail to uprights. Nail to the top of
this 2 &times; 4 along its centre a piece of 1 &times; 3 pine, the
same length as the 2 &times; 4. The box covers are to
be hinged to this pine strip and will rest on the
edge of the 2 &times; 4 which will carry the weight.</p>

<p>Seat covers are to be the same length as the box,
with just enough clearance to let them move freely
between the uprights. As they are 16 inches
wide, it is doubtful whether a single board that
width will be available. They may be made of
tongue and groove boards, with cleats 3 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches
screwed on the under side, just long enough to allow
the cover to close. Outside edges should be rounded
and three strong hinges used on each cover. As it
has a bearing surface on front and ends of the box,
no extra support will be needed.</p>

<p>If a support for the back is desired, two strips
3 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  with rounded edges may be fastened to
the uprights, and as the pressure may be both ways,
they should be nailed between two upright cleats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>at each end. The cleats <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  are nailed to
uprights, or the strips may be mortised through.</p>

<p>The sharp edges of the uprights may be bevelled
or chamfered where people are likely to come in
contact with them.</p>

<p>The structure is now ready for painting. Set
all nails with nail punch, and give the first or priming
coat to the whole structure, shingles excepted.
This should be done when the wood is dry, not
directly after a rain. When this coat is dry, fill
all nail holes with putty and give second coat of
paint. If the priming coat was thin a third coat may
be necessary to give the desired result. Use a little
drier in the paint and when necessary to thin it
use boiled linseed oil. As white would not be suitable
for the seats and floor, a light gray for the seats
and a darker shade for the floor may be used.</p>

<small>THE PERGOLA</small></h2>


<p>Among the many structures used to beautify
the grounds of a suburban or country place,
the pergola is seen less than it should be.
It is a luxury, but so is a couch hammock, and many
other details of our modern life might be placed
under the same heading. As an arbour for the training
of the vines, the pergola adds more dignity to
a place than any other structure, always assuming
that it is well built and in good proportion. Its
length must of course depend on the local circumstances.
It should lead somewhere, as from the
house to the flower garden, or from house to stable.
It should, in other words, not be placed on the grounds
simply as an ornament. Its purpose should be to
give a certain amount of privacy to a walk.</p>

<p>The oldest recognized style of architecture is
known as post and beam construction, as suggested
in <a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>, where two vertical members support
a horizontal one. This style was used by the
Egyptians and Greeks, and was a large factor in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>deciding the form of the old Greek temples. The
pergola consists of two parallel rows of columns
connected by longitudinal beams and cross beams.</p>

<p>A very artistic one may be built by two boys
with the assistance of a third person in the heavy
work of lifting and placing the columns. If a small-sized
structure with 6-inch columns is built, two
boys can handle the whole construction alone.</p>

<p>This small size is not recommended, however, as
one of the first requisites of the pergola is a massive
appearance of solidity and permanence.</p>

<p>The proportions for two sizes are given in the
drawing, and they may be modified to suit the size
of the ground, buildings, etc. (<a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a>.)</p>

<p>Wooden columns in many styles, sizes, and proportions
are on the market and may be bought from
any lumber dealer. The bases and caps are separate
and should be ordered to fit the columns.</p>

<p>The construction of the pergola brings the young
carpenter in contact with several new problems.
The first is the subject of foundations. These may
be in the form of concrete, which is permanent and
solid, and will not decay, as any form of wooden post
will do in time. The ground should be as nearly
level as possible, and should be staked out with
eight stakes, as shown in the drawing. (<a href="#fig221">Fig. 221</a>.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<a id="fig219"></a><img src="images/fig219.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 219. The Pergola</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>The stakes are three feet from the centre of the
columns in each case, and angle <i>a c d</i> should be
made square at the beginning. Measure distance
<i>a b</i> equal to <i>c d</i>. From <i>a</i> measure along a
line stretched from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> three feet, and then three
spaces of twelve feet each. Measure the same distance
from <i>c</i> along <i>c d</i>, and place stakes at each
point. A line stretched from <i>e</i> to <i>f</i> should pass over
the centre of the stakes marking the centre of each
column, as these latter stakes will be dug out in the
process of excavating for the foundation, while
stakes <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> are necessary for the proper location
of the holes.</p>

<p>After digging the first two holes, test their accuracy
by again stretching a cord or masons' line from
<i>e</i> to <i>f</i>. Proceed with the next set of holes in the
same way, placing new stakes three feet out from
centres to correspond with <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. When the eight
holes have been dug, the arrangement will appear
as shown at <i>g</i>, twelve stakes being left in the ground.
Should the pergola be longer or narrower, the same
method would be used, the dimensions only being
altered. The size of the holes will depend on the
following considerations:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig220"></a><img src="images/fig220.jpg" width="600" height="327" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 220. The pergola</div>

</div>

<p>Assuming that we are building the large pergola
with eight-inch columns, the base will be about twelve
inches square. Measure the base and add two inches
to it, making, say, a fourteen-inch square, the size
of the foundation. A box in the form shown at <i>a</i>, 14
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>inches square inside, must be made. No nails are
used on the box. It is held together by cleats <i>c c</i>.
They must be made to fit snugly, and are to be
knocked off when the cement has hardened&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
about four days after making.</p>

<p>These boxes may be full depth of the hole, three
feet, or, as is sometimes done, the hole is made just
the right size and the box, about eighteen inches in
length, wedged into the top as shown at <i>i</i>. This
method calls for considerable care in levelling the
top of the box and securing the proper projection
above ground, as well as in pouring in the cement
without dislodging it, but the box is removed
more easily than is the case with a full-length
one. The decision about this point determines the
size of the hole. In case the short box is used, the
hole must be fifteen inches square and just enough
shaved from the sides at top to receive the box.</p>

<p>If the full length box is used, the hole should
be about twenty inches square, to allow the cleats
to be knocked off and boards withdrawn.

<div class="caption">Fig. 221. Details of pergola construction</div>

</div>

<p>This weighty question having been decided, prepare
to mix concrete. Make a mixing board about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>five or six feet square of flooring boards fastened to
heavy cleats on the under side. It should have two
or three sides nailed on, as shown at <i>k</i>. Also prepare
eight wooden blocks, as shown in drawing. These
may be fifteen to eighteen inches long, sawed from
4 &times; 4 timber, planed smooth and with a slight taper
toward the lower end. The purpose of these blocks
will be apparent later on. The concrete is composed
of four parts clean gravel to one of Portland cement,
and the best is always the cheapest in the long run.
Use a pail for mixing and place four pailfuls of gravel
on the mixing board. Pour over this one pailful
of dry cement and mix thoroughly, turning the
whole mass several times. When thoroughly mixed,
pour on water, half a pailful at a time, and turn again
with the shovel until the whole mass is wet. Shovel
this into the first box. It will probably take two
such mixings to fill it. Now place in the top of the
concrete one of the tapering blocks, allowing it to
project about three or four inches above the surface
of the concrete. The block should be rubbed with
grease or oil before insertion to make it withdraw
easily. As soon as the block is placed, pass the line
from stakes <i>e</i> to <i>f</i> and make sure that the block is
exactly at the centre.</p>

<p>In every case it is to be withdrawn in about an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>hour, or as soon as the concrete has set, but before
it has gripped the block too tightly; otherwise withdrawal
will be a difficult matter. The object of this
performance is to leave in the centre of the foundation
a hole about a foot deep and four inches across.
Level the top of concrete with a trowel and test
with the level.</p>

<p>All the foundations are made alike and no effort
should be spared to see that the boxes are level and
in line with each other. Test from end stakes
<i>a b c d</i> and from across stakes with the masons'
line. This work will be easier if the four end
foundations are made first.</p>

<p>To do the work thoroughly, two boys may count
on the process, from the staking out to the finishing
of foundations, occupying about three days. It is
the most important and laborious part of the work
and when finished represents about one third of
the labour on the pergola.</p>

<p>The concrete should stand at least four days
before it is touched again, and during that time the
timber may be prepared. Besides the eight columns,
there will be needed:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="materials required">
<tr><td align="left">6 pcs. 4 &times; 6 ins.&mdash;16 ft. long</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15 pcs. 3 &times; 6 ins.&mdash;14 ft. long</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">8 pcs. of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round iron</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>The iron should be 18 inches longer than
the total height of the wooden columns, including
base and cap. This should be determined
by actual measurement. The rods can be obtained
from a blacksmith. Have him cut a thread at each
end and provide two nuts for each rod. They
are to extend clear through each column from the
bottom of the hole in the foundation, through the
longitudinal timbers that rest on the cap, to bolt
the whole structure together securely.</p>

<p>Columns come either built up or solid. The
solid ones have a core bored out through the
centre, so that in either case the rod can easily
pass through from top to bottom. A hole should
be bored <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch diameter through the centre of both
cap and base to allow the bolt to pass easily.</p>

<p>In ordering timbers, have them dressed on all
sides at the mill. Have the fifteen 3 &times; 6 inch
pieces sawed on both ends as shown at <i>l</i>, and have
one end on four of the 4 &times; 6 inch pieces sawed the
same shape. The two remaining 4 &times; 6 inch pieces
are to be square on the ends.</p>

<p>A week after making the concrete foundations,
the boxes having been removed and the holes filled
in with earth well tamped down, the openings in
the top may be cut out with a long cold chisel, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>shown at <i>m</i>. This need not be a very particular
job. The object is to dovetail the cement, to be
used in filling up the opening to the foundation,
and it can be done roughly. The setting of the columns
on their foundations is performed as follows:</p>

<p>Nail base and cap to each column and slip a long
bolt clear through. At the bottom the bolt will
be allowed to project. At the top pass it through
a piece of wood 6 inches high, a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hole being
bored for the purpose.</p>

<p>Fill the opening in the foundation with clear
cement mixed with enough water to bring it to the
consistency of paint. Set the column on its
foundation, with the end of the bolt and its nut
and a large washer immersed in the cement.
This will harden quickly, making a strong bond
with the foundation and holding the bolt rigid.
Plumb the column, and if it shows a tendency to
lean, place thin wedges under it until it stands true
when tested by the plumb and level on all sides.</p>

<p>Treat all the posts alike and when one row has
been set, run the masons' line along the bolts on top
and see that they are in line. Everything should
be ready before starting this job, as clear cement
hardens quickly and any moving of the columns that
may be necessary in lining them up must be done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>before it sets. A good method is to place the end
posts first, tie the masons' line to the bolts and line
the other two posts as they are set.</p>

<p>When they are all on their foundations at last
you will begin to realize for the first time the value
and beauty of the task you have undertaken. Our
boys were so excited that every member of the
family, and some of the neighbours, were dragged out
as spectators. It did not seem possible that two boys
could handle such a large proposition, but there it
stood as if it were intended to stand for a century.
Harry was for putting on the superstructure at
once, but Ralph had to warn him not to touch it
until the cement had thoroughly hardened.</p>

<p>They allowed it to stand two days before they
removed the 6-inch blocks from the bolts at the top
and began the work of placing the long 4 &times; 6 inch
timbers. These members were lapped as shown in
the drawing, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch holes being bored to receive
the bolts.</p>

<p>When all the timbers on one side were in place,
the nuts were screwed down snug on each bolt with
a monkey wrench. The work, with the cutting,
fitting, and boring, consumed a whole day, and a
second day was used up on the second row. It
was not necessary to call the family out again. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>boys had all the help that could be desired in lifting,
and were also blessed with a continuous audience.</p>

<p>The cross timbers were gained out to a depth of
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inches, and fitted over the long 4 &times; 6 inch
pieces, as shown at <i>n</i>. There was one over the
centre of each column, and an additional piece was
removed to provide for the nut, which was thereby
entirely concealed. The remaining cross pieces were
spaced three feet apart on centres, and all spiked
securely to the 4 &times; 6's. It was found advisable to
bore <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch holes for the spikes, and to sink their
heads below the surface with a nail set.</p>

<p>It only remained to nail on to the cross pieces
five rows of 1 &times; 2 in the position shown.</p>

<p>All nail holes and cracks were puttied, and the
entire structure down to the cement foundation
was given three coats of white paint. Built in this
manner, the pergola will stand for many years, and
already the boys have planted wistaria, honeysuckles,
crimson rambler, trumpet, and other vines to cover it.</p>

<p>The columns themselves may be easily made of
concrete. The form may be made of six or eight
inch iron pipe. When this is bought, have it split in
half lengthwise at a machine shop. Six-inch pipe cut
in this way will cost about a dollar a foot, but it
will last a lifetime if protected from rust, and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>often the concrete posts may be sold, so that the
form will soon pay for itself.</p>

<p>Have a blacksmith make two iron bands, as shown
at <i>o</i>. Have a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole drilled at <i>a</i> through both
ends. These bands are used to hold the two halves
of the iron form together, and are tightened by a
bolt and nut at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Dig a pit for the form to stand in, so that the
cement may be easily poured in. This pit may be
about three feet deep by two feet square, and the
sides supported by a box without a bottom.</p>

<p>To make a column, clamp the two bands about
the form, and place in the bottom end a circular
piece of wood, with a hole in the centre to insure the
iron rod being in the middle. Place the form upright
in the pit, and secure it firmly by nailing strips
of wood across the top of the box. Place the iron
rod in the centre, passing it through the hole in
the bottom. Pour in the cement quite wet, and tamp
it down occasionally until full. It will settle a little,
and will need to be filled to the top. A circular
piece of wood, similar to the one at the bottom, may
be used to centre the rod at the top. This must be
done as soon as the form is filled, before the concrete
has had a chance to set.</p>

<p>Use four parts of fine, clean sifted gravel to one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>cement. Allow the form to stand four days. Remove
the clamps, and draw the form out on the
ground. Tap it gently, and remove one half of the
iron pipe. Roll it over upon two pieces of board,
and remove the other half. The concrete will be very
heavy, and the assistance of a full-grown man may
be needed to draw the form out of the pit.</p>

<p>The inside of the form should be cleaned and
thoroughly oiled. This should always be done before
making a column to insure its coming out easily,
as concrete forms a strong bond with iron, and
otherwise the column may be broken in trying to
get it out. The result will be a perfectly round but
not perfectly smooth column. It should be coated
with a wash of clear cement and water, using a wide
brush. The colour may be made white by adding a
lump of lime to the cement and water, and two coats
of this solution about the consistency of milk will
be necessary. The last coat may be put on after the
columns are on their foundations. The placing of
the posts on the square foundations is heavy work
and the help of a labourer should be secured.</p>

<p>These plain posts are not as ornamental as wooden
columns, with their bases and capitals, but they make
a very substantial structure that cannot decay and
will last a century.</p>

<br />
<small>POULTRY HOUSES</small></h2>


<p>There are a hundred ways of raising chickens,
and ninety of them are wrong.</p>

<p>This is not a treatise on poultry raising,
for there are many elements which enter into the
problem&mdash;incubation, brooding, feeding, etc. But
assuming that one of the main points aimed at is
the production of eggs in winter, when they are
scarce and expensive, the <i>housing</i> of chickens is
admitted by poultry raisers to be one of the first
considerations.</p>

<p>The house should be sixteen feet deep, should
face south, and no glass should be used in its construction.
A window nine or ten feet long by two
and a half feet high placed four feet above the ground
is recommended, and it should be covered with
netting or chicken wire on the outside, but left open
all day, even in zero weather. It is closed at night,
by a screen of canvas or duck fastened to a light
wooden frame. The frame is hinged at the top, and
hooked up to the ceiling during the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>The following description is taken from the experience
of several poultry men who have been
successful, and have made money by selling
eggs.</p>

<p>The principle of this construction is that ventilation
is a prime necessity, and that dampness is the
one thing to be avoided. With these objects attained,
chickens will stand almost any amount of
cold, and with proper feeding and the strictest
cleanliness, egg production will continue throughout
the winter.</p>

<p>Some successful men insist on a wooden floor,
others recommend one of gravel ten inches deep.
The construction given here calls for the gravel
floor on the ground level.</p>

<p>Many recommend a litter of straw ten inches
or more deep on the gravel. The morning meal is
thrown on this litter so that the chickens are forced
to scratch for their breakfast, getting the blood in
circulation by this early morning exercise.</p>

<p>As the method of building this house is typical
of many outdoor structures, it will be taken up in
detail. It would make an excellent work shop or
cabin, with a few modifications, such as a floor of
boards, and the addition of a few windows. Before
it is finished the builders will probably regret, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>our boys did, that it was to be used by their
chickens instead of for themselves. (See <a href="#fig222">Fig. 222</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig222"></a><img src="images/fig222.jpg" width="600" height="443" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 222. The poultry house</div>

</div>

<p>Set eight locust or chestnut posts in the ground
and saw off six inches above the lowest point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>Level in the same manner as for the sheltered
seat described for the tennis court, and see that
the outsides of posts measure 15 feet 10 inches over
all measurements.</p>

<p>Square the corners by the 3-4-5 method, laying
the 4 &times; 4 inch sill pieces on top of posts while doing
this. The sill is put together with halved joint, and
spiked to the posts with twelve-penny wire nails.
The corner posts are 4 &times; 4 inch spruce, with square
ends toenailed to the sill.</p>

<p>Plumb these posts, and tie in position by temporary
braces, using for this purpose shingle lath or strips
of boards.</p>

<p>The plates along front and back are 2 &times; 4 inches,
nailed to posts from the top.</p>

<p>The frame may now be finished by placing the
2 &times; 4-inch studding, toenailing to sill and plates
on the ends, and sill and rafters on the sides.</p>

<p>The frames for door and window are shown in
the illustration.</p>

<p>The rafters spaced three feet apart are 2 &times; 8 or
2 &times; 10 inches. This large size is due to the long
span of sixteen feet, with no middle support from
underneath.</p>

<p>The ends of rafters are cut to fit snugly over
the plates, as shown, and sawed straight up and down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>to correspond with vertical walls front and back.
No overhang is provided for the roof, as commercial
roofing paper is to cover the whole outside of the
house. In case it is to be used for other purposes
than poultry raising, this feature should be modified,
and the rafters allowed to project both front and
back.</p>

<p>With the rafters nailed in position, permanent
braces may be put in at the corners, as shown in the
drawing, and temporary braces removed.</p>

<p>If the building is to be used as a shop, a second
door directly opposite the one shown is recommended.
For this purpose the position of the work
bench would be on the front directly under the long
window, and the two doors would then be in the
proper place to permit the planing of long boards.</p>

<p>When the frame is finished, the question of siding
must be taken up. If the original purpose of the
building is to be carried out, poultry experts claim
that a double wall is very desirable as a barrier
against dampness, which arises primarily from the
exhalations of the birds. If the walls are cold, this
dampness will condense on them, while with a double
wall this does not take place, as the dampness escapes
with the air. The outside casing may be of ship-lap
boards or tongued and grooved material. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>a cabin or shop, novelty siding, clapboards or even
shingles may be used. Bring the square ends of
the boards flush with the openings for door and
window, and nail to corner posts and studding with
eight or ten penny wire nails.</p>

<p>Finish the two sides, sawing off the sheathing
along the top of rafters. Cover front and back clear
up to top of rafters, and bring ends of boards flush
with outside of the side sheathing.</p>

<p>Several methods of finishing corners of frame
buildings are shown in <a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>. At <i>a</i> is shown the
corner of this chicken house. No corner boards are
used over the outer sheathing, as the whole structure
is to be covered with roofing paper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig223"></a><img src="images/fig223.jpg" width="600" height="792" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 223. Details of poultry house</div>

</div>

<p>At <i>b</i> is shown the finish for a stable or cheap
cottage, with outside trim nailed over the sheathing.
This is the cheapest, easiest, and poorest method
of corner finish for ordinary outhouses. At <i>c</i> a
better method is shown, with trim nailed to the posts,
and clapboards fitted up close to it and nailed to
corner posts. A still better finish is shown at <i>d</i>,
where the trim is nailed to posts but not lapped.
The angles between corner trim filled with a quarter
round moulding make a good joint and a neat finish.
If the double wall is to be used, a second boarding
is made on the inside of studding and under side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>of rafters, first covering the space with building
paper tacked to the inside of studding, and nailing
the boards&mdash;either ship-lap or tongue and groove&mdash;to
the frame work.</p>

<p>Door and window sills are made with an outward
slant to provide a water table. A cross section of
window sill is shown in the detail drawing at <i>e</i>.
As there is no window in this building except the
canvas screen, the construction of a window frame
is not necessary. If the double wall is made, a
double door, one opening in and the other out, will
be in order. The outside door, flush with outer
sheathing, and the same arrangement inside are
shown at <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>A door sill will not be necessary, and the construction
of the doors is shown at <i>g</i>. The material
is tongue and groove boards fitted to the opening,
so as to close easily, yet to provide for expansion
in wet weather, and held together by heavy cleats
3 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inches on the inside, as shown. The inner
door is fastened by a hook and eye, and the outer
one with hasp, staple, and padlock.</p>

<p>As the window opening is covered with wire, the
only way a thief can get in is by cutting the wire and
canvas or by drawing the staple. The latter method
can be prevented by the use of special staples, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>threads cut on each end, and fastened on the
inside by nuts, as shown at <i>h</i>. These staples are
sold at all hardware stores.</p>

<p>The construction of the frame for the canvas
screen is shown in <a href="#fig222">Fig. 222</a>. The lap joint is used
throughout, and the outside dimensions are two
inches greater than the window opening. Tack the
canvas or duck to the side of the frame next the window,
and provide two hooks and eyes to fasten it down
at night. Strong iron butt hinges should be used on
this frame, and heavy T or strap hinges on the doors.</p>

<p>The outside of the house is finished, except for a
water-shed over the window, and the cover for the
entire outside of strong roofing paper. This is sold
usually with a special cement for making tight joints
and with tin washers for the nails. The water table
is simply a board projecting at an angle and fastened
to triangular brackets, as shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig222">Fig. 222</a>).
The roofing paper brought down over this board, and
tacked to the under side or edge, makes a watertight
joint.</p>

<p>The inside woodwork consists of roosts, dropping
platform, and nests.</p>

<p>The dropping platform is a floor of tongue and
groove boards, placed three feet from the ground
on posts, and extending the full length of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>The roosts are fastened to a strong frame, as
shown in drawing, and the frame&mdash;in sections&mdash;is
hinged at the back. Each morning this frame is
raised, hooked to the ceiling, and the dropping
platform cleaned.</p>

<p>The construction of the nests is a subject on which
poultry experts differ widely, but whatever form is
adopted, the material may usually be obtained from
old boxes or packing cases.</p>

<p>The outdoor runs for summer consist of wire
netting fastened to chestnut, cedar, or locust posts.
If other woods are used, the lower parts should be
coated with creosote. This is also a good disinfectant,
to be used for cleaning the roosts occasionally.</p>

<p>Many accessories for the poultry house may be
made of wood, but opinions of specialists are so
antagonistic that it is hardly safe to advocate any
one type. A feed trough is shown at <i>i</i> (<a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>).
It may be made from box material, and consists of
two boards nailed together at right angles, supported
at the ends by two horizontal pieces nailed on.
Brooder houses, feed, and incubator houses, and the
many other details of poultry raising are well within
the power of any careful boy, and the designs should
be selected from the expert whose system he has
decided to follow.</p>

<br />
<small>HOUSING OF OUTDOOR PETS</small></h2>


<p>The care of rabbits, guinea pigs, and other
pets becomes of absorbing interest to every
boy at some time, and he is fortunate
indeed if he has room outdoors to engage in this
pastime properly.</p>

<p>The comfort of the little animals, and their protection
from their natural enemies, the cat, dog,
weasel, etc., should be well looked after. <a href="#fig224">Fig. 224</a>
shows a very simple and convenient house for animals
which do not gnaw through wood, as the rabbit
and guinea pig.</p>

<p>These two animals will usually live together
peaceably, except when breeding. The mothers become
sensitive and jealous of all strangers when
raising a family. The house proper has a sloping
roof, which is hinged to provide a convenient method
of reaching any part of the inside.</p>

<p>The large space covered on all sides by wire
netting is the yard, or runway.</p>

<p>The front of the house should face south, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>covered with netting, except the door, which slides
up in the grooves provided, as shown in the detail.</p>

<p>The northern end of yard is boarded clear up to
the top. This shuts off the cold north winds, and in
that kind of a house rabbits will live the year round.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig224"></a><img src="images/fig224.jpg" width="600" height="499" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 224. Rabbit house</div>

</div>

<p>Guinea pigs will thrive in such a structure until
the thermometer reaches zero.</p>

<p>These interesting and harmless creatures come
from Brazil, and when the temperature reaches that
point, it is better to take them indoors, as they catch
cold and die of pneumonia, like human beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>The runway is covered at the top with two-inch
wire netting to keep out cats, who seem to take
delight in killing both pigs and rabbits.</p>

<p>The upright corner posts should be set at least
two feet in the ground, braced along the top by
strips, to which the netting is fastened with staples,
or double-pointed tacks.</p>

<p>A hemlock board should be set in the ground all
around the yard, with a projection of an inch or
two for securing the netting at the ground line.</p>

<p>Hemlock is cheap and will last longer in the ground
than spruce. If the rabbits start to burrow, they
become discouraged by finding this board in the way
on every side. These planks or boards may be
rough-sawed lumber.</p>

<p>The inside of the house should be coated with
creosote and painted outside a bronze green. A
dark-coloured house is warmer than a white one, as
may be easily proved by placing a thermometer,
first under a black hat, then under a white one.
This is probably the reason why people in the tropics
wear white clothing.</p>

<p>A door the full height of the yard should be
provided at the far end, as it is sometimes necessary
to get in for cleaning or other purposes.</p>

<p>The hinged roof should be made water tight by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>covering with some form of commercial roofing paper,
or by using tongue and grooved boards well painted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 225. Traps</div>

</div>

<p>The door sliding in grooves, as shown, has a long
handle, which projects up
through the top of the runway,
so that it may be
opened or closed from the
outside. It can be made
from box material.</p>

<p>A number of these
houses may be placed in
a row and allowed to open
into a large yard, or there
may be individual runs.
The latter method is
more satisfactory, as a
large run can easily be
obtained by providing
doors between the yards.</p>

<p>In the country, where
weasels, mink or other wild
enemies bother the rabbits,
they can be caught in
traps. The ordinary box trap at <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig225">Fig. 225</a>, is
designed to catch the animals alive. Its construction
is clearly shown in the drawing, one end covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>wire netting, or made solid, and the other provided
with a door, arranged to drop easily in the groove
when the trigger has been disturbed. The simple
construction of the trigger is shown in the detail,
while the bait is attached to a string. As soon as
this is disturbed the door drops.</p>

<p>A typical dead-fall trap is shown at <i>b</i>. The
weights placed on the sloping board should be heavy,
as this trap is designed to kill its victim. For this
reason it should never be used where there is any
possibility of a pet cat or dog being caught. The
trigger is very sensitive, and the slightest pull at
the bait is sufficient to bring the weight down on the
unfortunate animal.</p>

<p>The uprights should be mortised through the
base board, and the cross piece at top halved to the
uprights. The sloping board with weights fastened
to it has a generous-sized hole fitted loosely over a
dowel at the right-hand end of bottom board. A
groove cut in the latter allows the weighted board
to fit tightly when it falls, the dowel with bait dropping
into the groove.</p>

<p><a href="#fig225">Fig. 225</a> at <i>c</i> shows a snare frequently used. It
should be placed in front of a hollow log, box, or
barrel, so that the animal must put his head through
the loop of wire in order to reach the bait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>The first pull at the end of the trigger releases
the spindle, and the bent sapling does the rest. The
loop of wire should be held open and in position by
twigs conveniently placed.</p>

<p>The killing of our few remaining wild creatures,
however, should never be done for sport. It is
excusable only when they become destructive or
troublesome. Squirrels, rabbits, and chipmunks are
much more interesting as friends than as caged or
killed victims.</p>

<small>OUTDOOR CARPENTRY</small></h2>


<p>Outdoor construction or carpentry, as distinguished
from the indoor work of the
cabinet maker, calls for a general acquaintance
with tools, some mathematics, an elementary
knowledge of the strength of materials, and a good
supply of common sense. It demands also some
knowledge of the effects of frost on foundations,
and requires judgment in providing for the elements,
wind, rain, snow, and sun.</p>

<p>Every building may be resolved into certain
parts, such as foundations, framing, roof, door, and
window frames, outside covering or siding, flooring,
partitions, doors and windows, wall covering or
ceiling, interior finish, hardware, etc. These will be
taken up in their order.</p>


<h3>FOUNDATIONS</h3>

<p>These, like all details, depend on the size and
purpose of the building. The method of setting
a small building on posts has been explained under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>poultry house, and sheltered seat for tennis court.
It should be used only for small structures, such as
camp buildings, sea-shore cottages, and out-buildings.
Brick, stone, and concrete all have their advantages,
but for young builders, concrete is perhaps the best
and easiest to handle. The woodwork necessary
for concrete work is extremely important, and its
possibilities have hardly been touched, even to-day.
The box or form should present the smooth side
of the boards to the concrete, and should be so constructed
that the form may be readily removed after
the concrete has hardened. This sounds like a simple
matter, but it becomes complicated in many cases.
The method of fastening the wooden frame to a concrete
foundation is suggested in the chapter on the
making of a pergola. In some houses the frame is
simply laid on the concrete, and the weight of the
building is trusted to keep it in place.</p>

<p>In the case of small structures this would not be
sufficient, and a better way would be to imbed bolts
in the cement before it hardens. Pass these bolts
through holes bored in the sill, and fasten them with
nut and washer on top, after the concrete has
hardened.</p>

<p>Any foundation should be sunk at least three
feet in the ground, otherwise it will be "heaved"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>by the frost. Where a cellar is to be built, the
foundation should be of sufficient depth to leave at
least 6 feet 6 inches in the clear between floor of
cellar and under side of floor beams, and seven feet
would be better. If the foundation extends two
feet above the ground, its bottom would be 5 feet
6 inches below the ground level.</p>

<p>The thickness of the concrete wall must depend
on the size and weight of the building, and for a
small cottage it should not be less than ten inches.
The columns described for the pergola make an
excellent foundation for a small building to be
placed on posts, as they do not decay and are permanent.
They may be used to advantage for
porches in place of wooden posts.</p>

<p>After a building is completed, some of the top soil
removed in digging the cellar should be graded up
to the foundation at a slight slope, to shed the rain
and carry it away from the building. The box for
a concrete wall should be well supported and braced,
as the weight is sufficient to force the boards out of
position. The method shown at <a href="#fig226">Fig. 226</a> is frequently
used, the <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  or 1 inch plank being supported by
2 &times; 4 inch studs, which in turn are braced as shown.
On cheap work the outside boarding is omitted, the
earth being shaved with the shovel as near the posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>tion
of outer casing as possible. Of course, this
earth wall is only useful within a foot or so from the
surface. At this point the
outer boarding must commence,
and be continued to
top of foundation. In order
to have the foundation level
on top, it is best to level the
wooden form all around the
four sides. If the concrete
is brought exactly to the top, and a straight edge
is run along the edges of the form, the resulting
wall must be level, provided the box has been made
so. Concrete does not flow enough to level itself.</p>

<h3>FRAMING</h3>

<p>This is a subject on which volumes have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>written. The general arrangement with the names
and sizes of the various members is shown in the
drawing, a design for a small cottage, or bungalow.
(<a href="#fig227">Fig. 227</a>.)</p>

<p>The heavy timbers forming the sill are cut to the
outside dimensions of foundation and halved at
the corners. Fasten the joints with ten or twelve
penny nails. Cut all corner posts exactly the same
length, toenail at corners to sill, and hold in position
by temporary braces. Plumb the posts as the braces
are nailed. Two boys must work at this job, one
holding the plumb and the other nailing the braces.
Cut and halve the ends of plate the same length
as sill, and nail to corner posts. Cut 2 &times; 4 studs same
length as posts, then nail to sill and plate 16 inches
apart on centres. The openings to be left for doors
and windows will break up the even spacing of the
studs, but it should be made as uniform as possible.
The spaces for door and window frames are to be
enclosed with double studs to give the necessary
strength. Corner braces are very desirable and in
the old-fashioned braced frame were mortised into
plate and post, and sill and post. (<a href="#fig227a">Fig. 227<i>a</i></a>.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 227a. Frame of bungalow</div>
</div>

<p>For a simple structure the necessary bracing
may be obtained by "letting into" the studding
3 &times; 1 inch strips, as shown in drawing. To do this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>hold the brace in the position it is to occupy, and
make a pencil mark on both sides of it on each timber,
sawing on the inside of these lines to a depth equal to
thickness of brace. Remove the wood between saw
cuts with a chisel. Test to see that brace comes
flush with outside of studs, and nail securely in
position.</p>

<p>When the frame is finished up to the roof the
putting on of the siding may begin at any time.</p>

<h3>SIDING</h3>

<p>The outside of the building, siding or weather
boarding, is an important item, as it is designed to
protect the interior from sun, cold, and storms. It
should be watertight, and may be made of various
materials, put on in several ways.</p>

<p>In a house to be used in winter, the first layer
should be of wide ship-lap boards. If put on diagonally
it will act as a permanent bracing, and while
this is the better way, it takes more time than horizontal
siding. In either case nail to every stud and
timber the board touches. Begin at the bottom
of sill, break joints as the work progresses upward,
and saw ends even with outside of posts.</p>

<p>At all door and window openings bring edges
of siding flush with openings.</p>

<p>This inner siding is to be covered with building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>paper, door and
window frames set,
tin flashing nailed
over doors and windows,
and outer
covering put on.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig228"></a><img src="images/fig228.jpg" width="400" height="728" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 228. Plan and elevation of a bungalow</div>

</div>

<p>Before proceeding
with outside
sheathing, however,
the roof
should be framed
and covered.</p>


<h3>ROOFING</h3>

<p>It is a difficult
matter to say that
one part of a house
is more important
than another, as
all parts are important,
but a
building with an unstable or leaky roof is an
abomination. The framing of the roof must
be strong enough to withstand gales, blizzards,
drenching rains, and the weight of tons of wet
snow.</p>

<p>As the method of shingling has been described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>under tennis court shelter, it is only necessary to
take up the subject of the frame. Boys will do well
to confine their early efforts to plain sloping, or
possibly hipped roofs.</p>

<p>These two styles are illustrated in <a href="#fig229">Fig. 229</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig229"></a><img src="images/fig229.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 229. Roof framing</div>

</div>

<p>The hip roof is the more pleasing and the more
difficult to make. It reduces the attic space, if
that is a consideration, and is harder to cover, or
rather it consumes more time, as the question of
whether a piece of work is difficult or not is really
a question of whether or not you know how to do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>The method of fitting the rafters is shown at
<a href="#fig230">Fig. 230</a>. To find length of rafters, make a drawing
to scale, in which <i>a-b</i> is the height above plate
level and <i>c-b</i> half the width of the building measured
on the plate or sill. The angle for cutting
the mitre at the ridge may be obtained from the
drawing, also the angles where the fit occurs at
the plate. The length should be distance <i>a-c</i>
plus about two feet for the overhang.</p>

<p>A ridge board is usually inserted between the
top ends of the rafters, and if made from a <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
board, half an inch should be deducted from the
length of rafters to allow for the difference.</p>

<p>The shape of lower end of rafters will depend on
the kind of finish or cornice to be used. Two kinds
are shown, the first and simpler being suitable
for a barn or rough building.</p>

<p>On account of the high price of lumber, most boys
will be obliged to use the most inexpensive style of
finish.</p>

<p>Cut all the rafters the same size, and in erecting
space them as nearly two feet apart as possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="fig230"></a><img src="images/fig230.jpg" width="600" height="343" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 230. Building details</div>

</div>

<p>The first pair should be flush with the edge of
plate and temporarily held in position by braces of
shingle lath. It will be necessary in erecting the
roof to place timbers and floor boards across the top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>of plate as a temporary floor to work on.
Nail rafters to ridge board, and plate with ten-penny
wire nails. Two boys must work together
on this job, as every part of the work must
be plumb.</p>

<p>When all the rafters are in place, cut and fit
the short studs between plate and rafters, being
careful to leave the openings for windows in the
places called for on the plan.</p>

<p>The ship-lap siding may now be continued up to top
edge of rafters, and sawed off even with upper
edge.</p>

<p>If novelty siding is used without any under
sheathing, it may be treated in the same way.</p>

<p>Shingling may now be done as described under
<a href="#TCA">tennis court accessories</a>.</p>


<h3>WINDOW AND DOOR FRAMES</h3>

<p>These may be bought at the mill ready made.
Very few carpenters make their own, as they are
staple articles coming in standard sizes. Second-hand
sashes and frames may often be bought at
very reasonable rates, and it never pays to make
either.</p>

<p>Set the frames in the openings left for them, and
nail to studs. To make sure that the fit between
frames and openings shall be right, it is best to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>the plans to the mill, and explain to the mill man just
what is desired.</p>


<h3>FLOORING</h3>

<p>The floor beams may be set at any time after the
frame has been erected up to the plate. As it will
be necessary to work around inside more or less,
the sooner they are in position the better. As these
beams, supposed to be 10 &times; 2 inches, often vary in
width, the floor is liable to be uneven, unless they
are cut to fit the sill.</p>

<p>The amount cut out need not be very much, but
a certain distance, say nine inches, should be marked
from the top edge, and the lower corner cut out as
shown at <i>d</i> (<a href="#fig230">Fig. 230</a>). This will bring all the top
edges level, when they are in position.</p>

<p>The span of the floor beams&mdash;the distance from
the sill to the next support&mdash;is important, as a
floor is called upon sometimes to support great
weight, as when a number of people are present, or
a heavy piece of furniture such as a piano
rests on it.</p>

<p>For floor beams 2 &times; 8, a span of not over
twelve feet should be allowed; for 2 &times; 10 a
slightly greater span may be used; but in either case
the supporting beam in the centre of the floor
should be halved into the sill with upper edge flush,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>and should be supported at intervals of ten feet by
posts set in the floor of cellar, or to a depth of three
feet in the ground in case there is no cellar. This
supporting beam should be placed when the sill
is set on foundation. Nail floor beams to sill, and
where the two beams from opposite sides of the
building lap or pass each other over the beam in
centre, nail them to each other and to the beam.</p>

<p>The flooring of tongue and groove stuff may now
be laid, cutting ends square and fitting them up
close to studding, or, what is still better, clear out
to the sheathing.</p>

<p>The outside weather boards may now be put
on, after deciding on one of the corner finishes
described under poultry house. A flashing of tin&mdash;painted&mdash;must
be placed over door and window
frames, before the clapboarding or siding reaches
these points. This siding is sawed off square, and
makes a butt joint with the outer casing of door
and window frames.</p>

<p>Some form of building paper is nailed to the
first siding in good buildings, and pays for itself in
the long run, by reducing the amount of fuel necessary
to heat the building in winter.</p>

<p>If the house is a sea-shore cottage or camp only
to be used in summer, both the paper and inner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>sheathing may be omitted, and the expense account
materially reduced.</p>

<p>The finishing of the interior may be left to the
last, or done on stormy days. In the meanwhile,
several important questions must be settled. One
is the style of flue or chimney to be provided for
the stove.</p>

<p>If the building is to be permanent, a brick chimney
should be built by a mason. The danger of fire
originating from defective bricklaying makes it
advisable to have this work done by a tradesman.</p>

<p>For summer cottages or camp buildings a simple
stove pipe can be used, but in any event it should
be put up before the final roof covering is on, and
"flashed," that is protected by tin laid over the roof
timbers, and made watertight. This does away with
leaks around the chimney, and the tin should be put
on in such a way as to prevent the shingles from
coming in direct contact with the hot chimney.</p>

<p>In these days of oil stoves, which are often used
for summer cooking, the chimney may be omitted
entirely. At the same time it must be remembered
that there are cold, damp nights, when a stove is
very comfortable at the shore or in the woods.</p>

<p>In regard to interior finish, if the walls are to be
plastered, three coats will need to be put on by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>skilled plasterer. Thin yellow pine ceiling stuff, often
used for camp buildings, is easily put on, and quite
satisfactory. Laid on diagonally it is very pleasing,
but the beads catch more dust than the vertical
strips do. The latter method calls for horizontal
strips laid between the studs for nailing, while a
simple quarter round moulding laid in all corners
gives the finish. A common practice in camps
is to have no interior wall covering, but to leave the
timbers exposed. For a dwelling, the frame should
be of dressed lumber, which may be stained to conform
with the general colour scheme.</p>

<p>The inside trim around doors and windows may
now be put on. Three methods of finishing around
windows are shown at <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> (<a href="#fig230">Fig. 230</a>), and one
of these types should be adopted before ordering
the trim from the mill. This work should be simplified
as much as possible, not only to save time,
but because decoration may well be left to pictures,
artistic metal work, trophies, and things which are
of interest from their history or association.</p>


<h3>DOORS AND WINDOWS</h3>

<p>If second-hand material is not used it is advisable
to purchase these staple articles from a mill where
they are made in standard sizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>When ordered for certain size spaces they come
a little too large. This allowance is for material
to be removed in fitting. Inside doors are usually
the last things to be hung. The windows should
be hung as soon as the construction will allow it,
in order to keep out rain.</p>

<p>Secure the pulleys for upper and lower sash into
the window frame on both sides of parting strip
about four inches from top of window frame.</p>

<p>Attach the sash cord and find its proper length
by experiment. Tie securely to sash weights. See
that the two sashes make a good, tight joint where
they meet, and tack the window stop to frame with
brads. The stop is to be ordered with the trim, and
mitred at the top. The construction at the sill is
shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig230">Fig. 230</a>).</p>

<p>The arrangement of door frames is shown at
<i>b</i>. After mitring the door stop, nail to door
frame at a distance from its edge equal to thickness
of door. Fit the door by planing to the space
inside frame. The hinges are put on as shown, being
sunk flush with edge of both door and door frame.
When hanging the door, it is a good plan to place
small wedges under it, to allow for the sag which will
result as soon as its weight is thrown on the hinges.</p>

<p>Saddles are usually placed under doors to allow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>them to swing clear of carpet and rugs. To allow
for the thickness of these saddles, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  inch should
be allowed between floor and bottom of door. The
saddles are to be fitted around edges of door frame,
making a neat finish.</p>

<p>For plastered walls a six-inch base board is necessary.
This may be put on with butt joints and
nailed to studding with small head finishing nails,
as for all trim.</p>

<p>The base is usually topped by a base moulding
mitred in the corners.</p>

<p>This style of construction is for a permanent
house. For rough or temporary buildings, many
modifications may be adopted. Batten doors, as
described for the poultry house, may be cheaply
and readily made.</p>

<p>Batten blinds made by the same method are very
desirable for buildings like summer camps, which
are to be vacant for long periods. This does away
with the temptation some people find to break windows
in unoccupied houses.</p>

<p>The siding for a small building may be of tongue
and groove boards put on vertically, and now that
lumber is so expensive these items are all important.</p>

<p>The lumber from packing cases may be used for
making very many of the pieces of furniture in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>camp, such as stools, benches, tables, shelves, cupboards,
bookcases, etc. Many of these useful
articles can be made without tearing the boxes
apart.</p>

<p>A very useful chest and seat combined may be
made by fitting a box with a strong cover,
strengthened by cleats on its under side and hinged
with strap hinges to the back.</p>

<p>A cushion of burlap filled with shavings, straw,
seaweed, or sweet grass will make this a very satisfactory
settee, and the storage space inside will always
be available. The outside of the box should
be smoothed, all nail holes filled with putty, and the
whole thing stained.</p>

<p>Very interesting panelling effects may be obtained
by tacking on strips of the same thickness as
the outside cleats.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 231. Chest made from packing case</div>

</div>

<p>Where the supply of wood is limited, many
similar articles will suggest themselves to the
young carpenter. The chair shown at <a href="#fig231">Fig. 231</a><i>a</i>
can all be made of wood from packing boxes, except
the square legs. These may be obtained by
sawing 2 &times; 4 inch spruce in half and planing
smooth. The rails can be put on with mortise
and tenon, or they may be gained into the legs
and fastened with nails or screws. The seat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>is built up of several pieces fastened to cleats
on under side, with front edges rounded. To
make this hard bottomed chair more comfortable,
have a thin cushion of canvas or burlap fastened
by a canvas
cover and tacked
to edges. The wide
strip across the back
may be treated in
the same way. One
coat of stain, or
two of Japalac or
some similarly prepared varnish will make a very
serviceable finish for camp purposes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 231a. Chair</div>
</div>

<p>The proportions of a porch settee of the same
general character are given at <a href="#fig231b">Fig. 231<i>b</i></a>. The
legs may be cut out of
pieces of spruce studding,
and all but the long rails
obtained from box material.
These long pieces
may be cut from <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch
siding left over when putting
up the cabin. Floor
boards with tongue and groove planed off will
answer very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>The long back strip will be more rigid if mortised
into the ends, and the upright strips will be needed
to give it the necessary strength.</p>

<p>One of the most comfortable articles for a camp
in the woods is the couch hammock. The materials
required are:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="materials">
<tr><td align="left">A cot.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Four yards of strong canvas a yard wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Forty feet of clothesline.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Two chains or strong pieces of rope about 4 or 5 feet long.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A grommet set and some grommets.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Remove the legs from the cot. They are usually
attached by bolts or rivets. If the latter, cut with
a cold chisel.</p>

<p>Lay the canvas in one piece on the floor and
place the cot at its centre. Make pencil marks
at the ends to indicate where the fold begins as at
B B (<a href="#fig232">Fig. 232</a>). Lap the canvas as shown and sew
securely, leaving a space at the fold for the clothesline
to pass through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>The square ends are to be hemmed and folded
over pieces of broomstick.</p>

<p>With the grommet punch make holes through
the canvas just below the broomstick and secure
with the grommets. Make these holes about 5
inches apart. They are to hold the line which is
to pass from iron fitting C through first grommet hole
and back until it has passed once through each
grommet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 232. Couch hammock made from a cot</div>

</div>

<p>The fitting is found on all hammocks and can
be taken from an old one, or an iron ring may be
substituted. Before beginning to weave the rope
through the grommets, pass its end down to B and
make fast to a stout screw eye fastened to under side
of frame of cot. This brings the weight on the rope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>instead of on the canvas, an important item when
five or six people sit on the couch at one time.
Treat both ends alike. The canvas will be wide
enough to fold up and entirely cover the edges of
cot. When everything has been adjusted, fasten
the chains or heavy rope to the iron rings, and secure
to the trees or veranda columns by heavy hooks.
A light mattress covered with blankets, or a specially
made cushion to cover the whole cot, and several
sofa pillows will add the finishing touches to a
very serviceable and satisfactory article.</p>

<p>The cost will be about one third of those on sale,
and this may be reduced 50 per cent. if a grommet
set can be borrowed, as this is the chief item of
expense, assuming that an old cot is used.</p>

<p>This hammock should not be left out in the rain,
as its steel springs will rust.</p>

<br />
<small>STAINING, POLISHING, AND FINISHING</small></h2>


<p>This branch of woodwork is a trade by itself
and under modern methods of specialization
the men who do this work do
nothing else. The methods of finishing are legion
and every polisher has a few little "kinks" of his
own which he regards as trade secrets.</p>

<p>The personal equation enters very largely into
the work, and if twenty boys have a given method
explained to them and they all polish, say, a box of
the same size and material, there will result twenty
different kinds of polished surfaces.</p>

<p>This is due to difference in temperament. Some
boys are patient and painstaking. Others are
nervously anxious to get through and see how it
looks. It is a fact particularly true of finishing that
it cannot be hurried without endangering the result.
Every coat must be thoroughly dry and hard before
the next one is put on. Different woods require
different treatment, and the elements of good taste,
colour, and harmony all enter into the problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>These statements are not made to discourage the
young woodworker, because finishing can be done
well by any boy who will use reasonable care, but to
emphasize the fact that it is poor policy to make
a fine piece of woodwork and then spoil it at the
last moment by hurry.</p>

<p>Staining is something on which opinions differ
greatly. Some artists claim that only the natural
colour of the wood should be used, but a great deal of
staining is done, and we must leave artistic arguments
to others.</p>

<p>The extent to which staining is carried may be
illustrated by the following finishes used on one kind
of wood&mdash;oak:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The writer believes that staining to make imitations
is wrong, such as staining cherry or birch
to give the impression of mahogany.</p>

<p>The list of materials for staining is very bewildering,
and it is advisable to reduce the list to a few
reliable ones and learn to use them well. They may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>be divided roughly into three classes: oil stains,
water stains, and stains produced from drugs or
chemicals.</p>

<p>Oil stains are dry colours ground in oil such as
chrome yellow, Prussian blue, burnt umber, burnt
sienna, etc. When preparing one of these for use,
thin with turpentine and linseed oil and apply with
a brush. After it has stood for a few moments rub
off with a piece of cotton waste or rag.</p>

<p>Water stains are colours dissolved in water.</p>

<p>After applying this kind allow it to dry. Sand-paper
the surface flat and apply a second coat of
half the strength.</p>

<p>Stains produced from drugs and chemicals include
such materials as logwood, bichromate of
potash, ammonia, iron sulphate, acetate of iron, etc.</p>

<p>The preparation of the surfaces to be finished is
very important and means the removing of any
defects, such as scratches, by means of plane, scraper,
and fine sand-paper.</p>

<p>These defects always show much more prominently
after polishing than before, so that too great
pains cannot be taken in preparation. Assuming
that the surface is ready, the first question to be
considered is whether the wood is open or close
grained. If an open grained wood, a coat of filler may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>be used; if close grained this may be dispensed with.
The following list will enable the beginner to
decide:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="wood">
<tr><td align="left">Open grained woods requiring filler:</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Oak, ash, chestnut, mahogany, walnut, butternut.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Close grained woods; no filler required:</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">White wood, pine, cherry, birch, beech, gum, sycamore or
  buttonball; maple, cedar, cypress, red wood.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Filler may be made at home, but it is a staple
article to be found in paint stores and it is advisable
to buy it ready made. It comes in paste and liquid
forms, and the paste is recommended. It must be
thinned with turpentine to the consistency of cream
and applied with a brush. As soon as it begins to
dry, rub off the excess across the grain with a handful
of excelsior, waste, burlap, or rags and allow it to
stand over night to dry.</p>

<p>When the wood is to be stained the colour is frequently
mixed with the filler.</p>

<p>The object of all this is to fill up the pores of the
wood to give a flat, solid surface for the polishing.
Sometimes even on open grained woods filler is
omitted entirely.</p>

<p>Suppose that the work in hand is a footstool
or tabourette made of oak and we wish to give it
a forest green finish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Staining and Polishing.</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The process would be as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>Prepare the stain by mixing a small quantity
of chrome yellow and Prussian blue on a piece of
wood. Mix thoroughly with a putty knife or old
chisel and thin with boiled linseed oil and turpentine;
add blue or yellow until a beautiful dark green is
obtained. Add this to the filler, using turpentine
for thinning, until the whole mass of liquid is the
desired colour and as thick as cream. Paint the footstool
all over with this filler. As soon as it starts
to dry, rub off as explained.</p>

<p>The next day sand-paper smooth and give a coat
of shellac. When hard, sand-paper flat and give a
second coat of shellac.</p>

<p>From this point on the process depends on whether
a glossy polish is desired or a dead flat surface.
For an article of furniture like a footstool a highly
polished surface would be a mistake, as it would
soon be scratched, and while furniture is not to be
abused, it is to be used, and shoe nails make
scratches.</p>

<p>A dead flat surface may be obtained by rubbing
down the third coat of shellac with fine ground
pumice stone or rotten stone and water. If too flat,
rub the surface with raw linseed oil and wipe dry.</p>

<p>Some boys will obtain a better finish with two
coats of shellac than others will with four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>After the first coat of shellac, varnish is often used
for the remaining coats, but it takes much longer
to harden and requires careful handling.</p>

<p>Shellac is a product obtained from certain trees
in the Orient. It may be bought in the dry state
at paint stores and dissolved in alcohol. Grain
alcohol is the best and most expensive, but wood
alcohol is cheaper and will answer all ordinary
purposes. The shellac may be bought in cans all
ready for use, and there are two distinct kinds&mdash;orange
and white.</p>

<p>White shellac is the more expensive, but should
be used on light-coloured woods, such as maple, to
avoid spoiling the colour.</p>

<p>Varnish comes in so many grades and kinds that
it is best to go to a reliable dealer and tell him just
for what purpose you expect to use it. There are
outside varnishes, rubbing varnishes, light flowing
varnishes, etc.</p>

<p>When by exposure it becomes thick so that the
brush drags, it should be thinned with a little
turpentine.</p>

<p>There is a great difference in the methods of
using shellac and varnish. The former being dissolved
in alcohol evaporates quickly, so that it
must be put on thinly and as rapidly as possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>Varnish, on the other hand, may take forty-eight
hours or more to dry, so that the brush can be
drawn over the surface several times to remove air
bubbles. It is not possible to do this with shellac.
The brush used in shellac should never be laid on
the top of the jar or can, as it will harden in a very
short time. The care of brushes is an important
item. Varnish brushes should be cleaned
with turpentine, shellac brushes with alcohol,
and when cleaned it is better to keep all brushes
in a pail of water than to allow them to become dry.</p>

<p>The jar or wide mouthed bottle used for shellac
should be kept covered else a great deal will be lost
by evaporation. A jam jar makes a convenient
receptacle for this, as it has an opening wide enough
to allow the use of a flat brush. Evaporation may
be prevented by inverting another jar of the same
size over it. The shellac on the rim will hold them
together practically airtight with the brush inside.</p>


<h3>RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF OIL AND WATER STAINS</h3>

<p>The merits of these two classes of stains may
be stated briefly. Water stains enter more deeply
into the pores of the wood because of their lighter
body. The hard parts of the surface hold practically
none of the stain and constitute the high lights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>of the finished surface. But water stains raise the
grain and make sand-papering necessary to bring
the surface flat again. For this reason, some
polishers first give a coat of water to raise the grain
and when dry sand-paper flat before staining.</p>

<p>Oil stains do not raise the grain, but owing to
their heavier body do not penetrate so deeply and
more of the stain is lost in rubbing off. Oil has a
tendency to darken wood, so that wood stained
with oil colours has a tendency to become clouded
or muddy with age.</p>

<p>For staining old work, oil stains should be used
rather than water stains. Old work has the pores
already filled and water has little chance to
penetrate.</p>

<p>Some chemicals and aniline dyes are very satisfactory.
Bismarck brown, which may be bought
at the chemist's as a powder, is soluble in alcohol
and gives a rich reddish brown. It is very powerful
and a very small quantity is necessary. Bichromate
of potash comes in the form of lumps and crystals.
It is soluble in water. Put half a dozen crystals
in a quart milk bottle of water and allow it to stand
over night. Warm or hot water will dissolve the
crystals more quickly. It is to be put on with a brush
and gives rich brown tints, the shade depending on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>strength, the kind of wood and the number of coats.
It gives excellent results on oak and chestnut, and
is used to "age" bay wood to a dark mahogany, while
several coats of it will bring white wood to the colour
of natural black walnut.</p>

<p>Each coat must be allowed to dry and then be
rubbed flat with fine sand-paper.</p>

<p>This treatment may be followed by two or three
coats of orange shellac, rubbed down.</p>

<p>For "antique" finish on oak or chestnut, dissolve
lampblack in turpentine, mix with filler and proceed
with polishing as explained.</p>

<p>A decoction of logwood is often used to produce
dark and even black effects. The logwood extract
is cheap and comes in the form of gum or resin.
Several lumps of this are boiled in a gallon of water
and applied as any water stain.</p>

<p>Acetate of iron, made from iron filings and vinegar,
is used for dark browns occasionally. The
filings should be allowed to stand for several days
in the vinegar. The acid present is acetic. It
unites with the iron forming the acetate of iron.</p>


<h3>POLISHING</h3>

<p>The method given above is for a substantial
solid finish, but sometimes a boy will have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>difficulty in obtaining the desired finish through
lack of patience or some other cause.</p>

<p>A French polish may help to give the finishing
touch. For this a piece of cheese cloth about 6
inches square, a piece of cotton waste about the size
of a walnut, a little shellac and raw linseed oil
are necessary.</p>

<p>Dip the waste lightly in shellac; fold the cheese
cloth around it, making a soft pad, dip the pad in the
oil and rub quickly and constantly in circles, gradually
covering the whole surface. As the shellac
hardens or sticks, use a little more oil and squeeze
the pad slightly to bring the shellac through the
cheese cloth. The oil prevents the shellac from
sticking and a little experience will give the right
balance between the two. When the polish becomes
so bright that it shows the slightest finger mark,
wipe dry with a piece of soft flannel.</p>


<h3>WAX POLISH</h3>

<p>This is used where a dull or flat finish is required.
It can be applied directly after staining or filling.</p>

<p>Dissolve beeswax in turpentine to the consistency
of filler. Heat hastens this part of the process,
but is not necessary unless time is a consideration.
The wax is applied with a soft rag or waste and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>rubbed and rubbed. The turpentine evaporates,
leaving the wax. Several rubbings at intervals of
a week will give the desired effect, and the surface
may be brightened at any time by an additional
application.</p>

<p>It should be remembered in all forms of polishing
that dust is the great enemy. Wherever possible
a piece of furniture after receiving a coat of shellac
or varnish should be placed in a room or closet
where no dust can settle on it. It should also be
kept out of the sun to avoid blistering. The action
of some stains like bichromate of potash is affected
by the sun and should be either kept out of direct
sunlight entirely or so placed that all parts receive
the same amount, else the parts in shadow will
be of a different shade from the rest of the surface.</p>

<br />
<small>DURABILITY, DECAY, AND PRESERVATION OF WOOD</small></h2>


<p>It is now known that decay in wood is caused
by fungi or low forms of plant life which cannot
live without a certain amount of water, food,
heat and air.</p>

<p>A fence post decays first at the place where it
enters the ground, because at that point the conditions
are most favourable. If wood can be kept
entirely under water, one item&mdash;air&mdash;is lacking, so
the fungous growths cannot exist and the wood will
last indefinitely. This has been proved in many
instances. One of the old Viking ships was raised
from the bottom of the Christiania Fjord, Norway,
after having been under water for a thousand years
and it was found to be in a perfect state of preservation.
Even the rudder oar or steerboard and
wooden shields were intact.</p>

<p>As soon as it was brought into the air the
process of decay began, and it became necessary
to coat it with preservative. It stands today,
103 feet long, in the museum at Christiania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
Many other instances of under-water preservation
might be mentioned.</p>

<p>The other extreme is also true. Wood which is
kept perfectly dry will last indefinitely, as in the case
of woodwork taken from the pyramids of Egypt,
3,000 years old, which is found to be perfectly
preserved.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a id="fig233"></a><img src="images/fig233.jpg" width="250" height="405" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 233. A pile</div>

</div>

<p>But when wood is alternately wet and dry it
decays rapidly. A pile driven into the bottom of a
tidal river is a good illustration.
If such a pile be divided into four
sections (see <a href="#fig233">Fig. 233</a>), <i>a</i> is always
in the ground, <i>b</i> is always
in the water, <i>c</i> is alternately in
air and water, <i>d</i> is always in the
air. Sections <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> may be
considered to be under the same
conditions and should last the
longest; <i>c</i> should decay first:
<i>d</i> would last indefinitely if the
atmosphere were always perfectly dry; but humidity
and rain, air and heat combined finally bring about
decay, and although this part of the pile will last
longer than <i>c</i> it will in time decay. Section <i>c</i>
should be coated with a preservative.</p>

<p>Various woods under the same conditions act very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>differently and according to no well understood law.
For example, in contact with the soil black locust
is our most durable wood. It is very hard, and its
life under these conditions is estimated at from
ninety to a hundred years. Red cedar comes next,
though it is soft wood. Oak decays in a few years;
chestnut, much softer, lasts two or three times as
long. Our approaching timber famine has induced
a study of this subject, since the preservation of
wood is becoming an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>It has been found that certain materials put on
the wood before it is placed in the ground prolong
its life. Coal tar, wood tar, paint, and creosote all
help, but creosote has so far proved to be the best.
It is one of the by-products of coal tar and is being
used extensively by the railroad companies for
prolonging the life of ties.</p>

<p>Experiments with creosote have brought out some
very interesting facts. It has been found that after
being treated with the hot creosote all woods resist
decay alike, regardless of their hardness or softness.
Consequently, a treated cheap wood will last as long
as an originally valuable one. This is a great gain,
as it allows us to make use of wood like the poplar
which would otherwise be practically of no value.</p>

<p>The various coatings we put on wood, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>paint, varnish, oil, etc., are intended not only to
beautify but to preserve it, which they do by filling
up the pores and excluding moisture, preventing
fungous growths, etc.
All of these coatings
should be put only
on dry wood, else
they prevent evaporation
of the sap and
may hasten decay.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="fig234"></a><img src="images/fig234.jpg" width="400" height="459" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 234. Strains</div>

</div>

<p>Drying lumber increases
its strength,
as it has been found
by experiment, even
as much as 400 per
cent. if no checking
occurs. When this happens it counteracts much of
the gain, and if the wood absorbs moisture once
more the strength will decrease. The strength of
the various timbers varies greatly, and sap wood is
usually weaker than heart wood.</p>

<p>The strains that may be brought to bear on
timbers are illustrated in <a href="#fig234">Fig. 234</a>, the arrows indicating
the directions in which the forces operate.
At <i>a</i> the wood is under tension, the forces at work
on it tending to pull it apart. At <i>b</i> the piece is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>under compression, the forces tending to reduce its
length by forcing its fibres together. A pillar supporting
a weight is under compression. At <i>c</i> the
weight tends to bend the beam. The upper part
is under tension, the lower part under compression.
This is known as beam action, and depends on
whether the beam is supported at one end, as shown,
or on both ends. Also it is important to know
whether the beam has a uniformly distributed load
or whether the weight is at one point only. The
problems relative to beam action are largely of an
engineering character and involve considerable
mathematics.</p>

<p>Shearing is the sliding of one part of the timber
along the grain. If a piece of wood is cut to the
form shown at <i>d</i> and a weight applied at <i>e</i>, the tendency
will be for this upper part to slide down as
shown at <i>f</i>. When this occurs, shearing has
taken place.</p>

<p>The strength of wood differs in resisting these
various strains, the tensile strength being greater
than the crushing or compressive strength. Ash, for
example, has a tensile strength of 16,000 pounds to
the square inch, but its crushing strength is only
6800 for the same size. The tensile strength of
dry white pine is 10,000 pounds, its crushing strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>5400 pounds, and its shearing strength varies from
250 pounds to 500 pounds, showing that its weakest
point is along the grain. If the young woodworker
becomes ambitious enough to think of designing
a bridge or large building he can find these figures
in any engineers' hand-book. There are so many
important factors to be considered that the amateur
will do well to go ahead with great caution. Knots
and other defects reduce the proportionate strength
of large beams greatly, so that it would not be safe
to assume that a beam 6 inches square would be
36 times as strong as a piece 1 inch square.</p>

<p>In upright posts of considerable length, not
alone the crushing strength must be considered, but
a bending action enters into the problem. Wherever
the question of danger to life enters, as in a
bridge or a house, it is wise to leave a large margin
for safety. We realize this fully when we read of
a grand stand holding hundreds or thousands of
people collapsing under the weight. The architect
has also to reckon with still other elements, such as
wind pressure and vibration.</p>

<h2><a name="LI" id="LI">LI</a><br />
<br />
<small>MATHEMATICS OF WOODWORK</small></h2>


<p>The woodworker soon discovers that arithmetic
is a very practical and necessary
subject. He will meet many problems
both in drawing and in actual construction which
test his ability and call for some knowledge even
of elementary geometry. It is important to be
able to estimate from his drawing just how much
lumber will be needed. He will soon discover
through intercourse with dealers in lumber that
there are certain standard sizes, and he should
make his designs as far as possible conform at
least to standard thicknesses.</p>

<p>Common boards are sawed 1 inch thick. When
dressed on two sides the thickness is reduced to
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> . In planning some part of a structure to be 1
inch thick it is better to make the dimension
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  inch, else it will be necessary to have heavier
material planed to 1 inch and the cost will be that
of the heavier lumber, plus the expense of planing.
In buying <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch dressed lumber, very often inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>boards are dressed down to the required thickness,
and the purchaser pays for 1-inch wood, in addition
to the dressing. The boy is surprised to find
that it costs more for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch than for inch material.
Standard lengths are 10, 12, 14, 16, etc., feet.
Widths vary, and as wood shrinks only across
the grain&mdash;with one or two exceptions&mdash;this dimension
cannot be depended on, as the amount of
shrinkage depends somewhat on the age after cutting.
Whenever possible, it is wise to go to the lumber yard
and select your own material, choosing boards that
are free from knots, shakes, etc. Clear lumber&mdash;free
from knots&mdash;costs more, but is worth the difference.</p>


<h3>MEASUREMENTS</h3>

<p>A measurement is a comparison. We measure
the length of a lot by comparing it with the standard
of length, the yard or foot. We measure a farm
by comparing its area with the standard unit of
surface measure, the acre, square rod, or square
yard.</p>

<p>In every measurement we must first have an
accepted standard unit. The history of units of
measurement is a very interesting one, and its difficulty
arises from the fact that no two things in
nature are the same. One of the ancient units
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>of length was the cubit, supposed to be the length
of a man's forearm, from the elbow to the end of
the middle finger. This, like other natural units,
varied and was therefore unreliable. As civilization
progressed it became necessary for the various
governments to take up the question of units of
measurements and to define just what they
should be.</p>

<p>Our own standards are copied from those of Great
Britain, and although congress is empowered to
prescribe what shall be our units, little has been
changed, so that with few exceptions we are still
using English measurements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>The original English definition of an inch was
"three barley corns" with rounded ends. The
meter is 1/10,000,000 (one ten-millionth) of a quadrant
of the earth's circumference, <i>i. e.</i>, the distance from
the pole to the equator measured along one of the
meridians of longitude. The length of three barley
corns might be different from the next three, so
here was the original difficulty again. The
designers of the metric system went back to
the earth itself as the only unchangeable thing&mdash;and&mdash;are
we sure there is no change in
the earth's circumference? The great advantage
of the metric is that it is a decimal system
and includes weights as well as surfaces
and solids. Our weights are even more distracting
than our long measure. We have in
fact two kinds of weight measure&mdash;troy and
avoirdupois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>Isn't it about time we used the metric system?
The reader will not mind one more standard unit.
Lumber is measured by the board foot. Its dimensions
are 12 &times; 12 &times; 1 inches; it contains 144 cubic
inches and is 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>  of a cubic foot. A board
10 feet long, 1 foot wide and 1 inch thick contains
10 board feet. One of the same length and width
but only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  inch thick contains 5 board feet.</p>

<p>The contents of any piece of timber reduced to
cubic inches can be found in board feet by dividing
by 144, or from cubic feet by multiplying by 12.
As simple examples: How many board feet in a
piece of lumber containing 2,880 cubic inches?
<sup>2880</sup>&frasl;<sub>144</sub>  = 20 board feet. How much wood in a joist
16 feet long, 12 inches wide and 6 inches thick?
16 &times; 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  = 8 cubic feet: 8 &times; 12 = 96 board feet.
A simpler method may be used in most cases. How
much wood in a beam 9 inches &times; 6 inches, 14 feet long?
Imagine this timber built up of 1-inch boards.
As there are nine of them, and each 14 ft. &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
foot &times; 1 inch and contains 7 board feet (<a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a>),
7 &times; 9 = 63 board feet. Again, how much wood in a
timber 8 inches &times; 4 inches, 18 feet long? This
is equivalent to 4 boards 1 inch thick and 8 inches
or <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  foot wide. Each board is 18 &times; <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> &times; 1 = 12
board feet, and 12 &times; 4 = 48, answer. (See <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a>).</p>

<p>It is not likely that a boy would often need to
figure such an example, but if the approximate weight
of such a timber were desired, this method could be
used, reducing the answer to cubic feet and multiplying
by the weight per cubic foot.</p>

<p>A knowledge of square root is often of great value
to the woodworker for estimating diagonals or
squaring foundations. The latter is usually based on
the known relation of an hypothenuse to its base and
altitude. It is the carpenters' 3-4-5 rule. The
square of the base added to the square of the altitude
= square of the hypothenuse. 3&sup2; = 9, 4&sup2; = 16;
9 + 16 = 25. The square root of 25 is 5. (See <a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a>).
To square the corner of his foundation the carpenter
measures 6 feet one way and 8 the other. If
his 10-foot pole just touches the two marks, the
corner is square. 6&sup2; = 36, 8&sup2; = 64; 36 + 64 = 100.
&radic;100 = 10. This method was used in laying out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
tennis court, the figures being 36, 48, 60&mdash;3, 4, and
5 multiplied by 12.</p>

<p>To take a more practical case, suppose we are
called upon to estimate exactly, without any allowance
for waste, the amount of lumber in a packing
case built of one-inch stock, whose outside dimensions
are 4 feet 8 inches &times; 3 feet 2 inches &times; 2 feet
8 inches. Referring to the drawing (<a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a>, <i>d</i>), we
draw up the following bill of material:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tablesmall"  border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="materials">
<tr><td align="left">2 </td><td align="left">&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;</td><td align="left">(top and bottom)</td><td class="tpl">4 ft. 8 in. &times; 3 ft. 2 in.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2 </td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Prime;</td><td align="left">(sides)</td><td class="tpl"> 4 ft. 8 in. &times; 2 ft. 6 in.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The top and bottom, extending full length and
width, are the full dimensions of the box, while the
sides, although full length, are not the full height, on
account of the thickness of the top and bottom pieces&mdash;hence
the dimensions, 2 feet 6 inches. From the
ends must be deducted two inches from each dimension,
for the same reason. In multiplying,
simplify as much as possible. There are four
pieces 2 feet 6 inches wide; as their combined length
is 15 feet 4 inches, we have 15<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  feet &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  feet =
38<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  square feet. The combined length of top and
bottom is 9 feet 4 inches = 9<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>  = 29<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> , and
38<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  + 29<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>  = 67<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>  or 68 board feet, ignoring such a
small amount as <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>  of a foot. This is close figuring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>too close for practical work, but it is better to
figure the exact amount, and then make allowances
for waste, than to depend on loose methods of
figuring, such as dropping
fractions, to take
care of the waste.</p>

<p>As a good example of
estimation, take the
hexagonal tabourette
shown in <a href="#fig178">Fig. 178</a>; the
five pieces, aside from
the hexagon under and
supporting the top, which
may be made from
scrap lumber, are shown
laid out in <a href="#fig236">Fig. 236</a>.
The board must be at
least twelve inches wide
in order to get out of it
the large hexagon. The
legs may be laid out as
shown with space left between for sawing, yet even
by this method considerable waste will result, and
it should be kept constantly in mind that as far
as possible waste is to be reduced to a minimum.
"Wood butcher" is the common shop name for

material before starting is that it not only makes
you study your drawing, but causes you to consider
the best method of laying out the blank pieces.</p>

<p>It is often necessary to find the areas of figures
other than the square or parallelogram. Assume
that we are to floor a room in an octagonal tower or
summer house. If the distance across the flat sides
of the octagon is sixteen feet, leaving out the item
of waste, how many square feet will be required?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="fig237"></a><img src="images/fig237.jpg" width="200" height="183" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 237. Finding the area of an octagon</div>

</div>

<p>The octagon may be drawn in a square and its
area will be that of the square, less the four triangles
in the corners. (<a href="#fig237">Fig. 237</a>). So the problem resolves
itself into finding the area of one of these triangles.
If we knew the length of one of the sides of the octagon,
the solution would be simple, but we only
know that the eight sides are equal. The following
method may be worked out: Find the diagonal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>of the sixteen foot square. It is 22.6+. Deduct
the distance across the flats, 16, leaving 6.6 feet
equally divided between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>; <i>a</i> = 3.3 and it may
be proved that <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> = <i>d</i>. So in each corner we have
a triangle whose base is 6.6 &times; 3.3.
The area of a triangle equals half
its base by the altitude. Therefore
the area of each triangle is
3.3 &times; 3.3 and 3.3 &times; 3.3 &times; 4 equals
43.56 square feet, the combined
area of the four corners. This deducted
from the area of the square leaves the area
of the octagon, or 256-43.56 = 212.44 square feet.</p>

<p>Assume that our problem is to find the narrowest
board we can use to cut out a
hexagon whose diameter is fourteen
inches. As shown in Chapter
IV, the hexagon is drawn in a
circle. One of the sides is equal
to the radius or half the diameter.
This gives us the arrangement
shown in <a href="#fig238">Fig. 238</a>, in which
our problem is confined to the right-angled
triangle whose base is seven and hypothenuse
fourteen. From our knowledge of triangles, we
deduct the square of seven (49) from the square of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>14 (196), leaving 196-49 = 147, which is the square
of the altitude. Then &radic;147 = 12.12, which is the
narrowest board from which we can obtain a hexagon
14 inches in diameter.</p>

<small>LUMBER: NO. 1</small></h2>


<p>It is hardly possible for a boy to select and purchase
wood for his various purposes without
some knowledge of the different woods and their
peculiar characteristics. No two are exactly alike,
and in fact two trees of the same kind growing in
different parts of the country under different conditions
will produce timber of very different qualities.
This is specially noticeable in the tulip or white
wood, for example. A tree of this species, growing
in a swamp in the South, will yield a very different
wood from one grown on high ground in the
North.</p>

<p>Again, the same wood is known in different
localities by different names, so in order to have a
sound knowledge of lumber, it is really necessary
to know something about the trees. White wood,
just mentioned, is called, in many localities, yellow
poplar. As a matter of fact, it is not a poplar, nor
is it related to the poplars, being a member of the
magnolia family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>The following pages, devoted to this subject, are
the cream of many talks between our boys, boiled
down to the important facts and arranged in some
order. It was a hobby of Ralph's, and Harry became
so enthusiastic over it that they frequently
laid aside their work and took long walks through
the country studying trees.</p>

<p>Harry started a small nursery in the garden
and is raising young trees from seeds and cuttings.
As he remarked to Ralph one day: "It's astonishing
how little people know about trees! Why they are
the most interesting things that grow. Just think
how many things we get from them besides wood;
maple sugar, rubber, turpentine, wood alcohol,
tannin for making leather, shellac, Canada balsam,
spruce gum, and nuts! All of our nuts except
peanuts come from trees&mdash;hickory, walnuts, butternuts,
beechnuts, chestnuts, pecans, almonds, etc."</p>

<p>Ralph noticed that as Harry's interest in the
trees grew he became less wasteful of his wood in
the shop. The fact that a tree had to be cut, and
in most cases killed, in order to furnish him with
lumber, seemed to worry him. One day when he
was thoughtfully at work in the shop, he blurted
out, "It's a shame that so many trees have to be
cut down for lumber!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>"Yes," said Ralph, "it seems so; yet if no lumber
was wasted, it would not be so bad. It is estimated
that 75 per cent. of the wood cut down is
wasted."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, many lumbermen after
cutting the tree down, take just the log or lower
part and leave the top to decay. It often happens
that they leave the tops and branches as a great
mass of litter, which soon becomes as dry as tinder,
an invitation to the smallest spark to start a fire,
and more woodland is destroyed by fire each year
than I care to tell you."</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Every year, between twelve and fifteen million
acres, and some years three times as much."</p>

<p>"How much is a million acres?"</p>

<p>"You can get some idea from this: Long
Island, N. Y., is a hundred miles long and about
twenty across in the widest part. It contains about
a million acres. Imagine this covered by solid
woods, multiply by fifteen and you would have a
good idea of the amount of woodland burned over
every year."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed the boy. "I should think
every tree would have been burned years ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>"Well, this is a big country," said Ralph. "I
figured it out once. The United States is large
enough to make six hundred states the size of Connecticut,
and have room for twenty-five or thirty
more. The state of Texas alone could be cut up
into a hundred pieces as large as Connecticut.</p>

<p>"The forest fire is one of our worst enemies. It
is far worse than the lumberman, because when
he cuts down trees it gives hundreds of young
seedlings which are struggling to live in the shade a
chance to grow and cover the ground with a new
forest; but the fire kills these young seedlings and
even burns the seeds that are lying in the leaves
waiting to grow. That is one of the worst things
to be said against the forest fire."</p>

<p>"Does it kill every tree?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Trees like the oak sprout from the old
roots, but most evergreen trees are killed outright."</p>

<p>"What happens then?"</p>

<p>"Why, it depends. If the forest is mixed, hard
woods and conifers, the hard woods, or some of
them, will in time send up sprouts, and where you
formerly had a mixed stand, you will in a few years
have only hard woods, unless some of the evergreens
were not touched. In that case, their seeds will
in time replace the old evergreens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>"How long does it take?"</p>

<p>"From forty to a hundred years to have a large
forest. Some evergreens, like the spruce, increase
in diameter very slowly."</p>

<p>"What happens when the forest that is burned
is all evergreens, and they are all killed?" asked
the irrepressible boy.</p>

<p>"The process of reforesting in that case is very
slow. Trees of little value, like the poplar or birch,
appear first, because their seeds are light and are
carried a considerable distance by the wind. If
fires pass over the same area every few years, the
forest will never come back unless seeds are planted.
There are large areas in this country thus denuded,
and instead of a forest we have a scrubby growth of
bushes that are of little value to anybody.</p>

<p>"Huckleberries grow in burned-over land luxuriantly,
and in some sections it is suspected that
the people who make money by gathering the
berries burn the brush purposely.</p>

<p>"The forest cover is valuable for other things besides
timber. The snow melts slowly in an evergreen
forest, because the rays of the sun cannot
penetrate with full strength. This allows the water
to sink into the ground slowly, and to come out
lower down in the form of springs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>"Where there is no forest the snow melts much
more quickly, the water rushes down the hills in
streams, carrying with it the top soil, which is of
so much value to the farmer, cutting the hillsides
into gullies, causing floods in the valleys, and filling
up the rivers with silt or mud.</p>

<p>"This spoils the streams, ruins the land, and causes
millions of dollars' worth of damage to property.
If you doubt it, read the newspaper accounts of
floods in the valleys of the Ohio, Missouri, and
Mississippi every spring."</p>

<p>"But I should think by this time all the soil
would be washed away."</p>

<p>"It will be in time. There are large areas in
China where the soil is washed away to the bare
rock. The population has been obliged to emigrate
because when the soil goes, the population can no
longer live."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do about it?" asked
Harry in amazement.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Ralph, warming up to his
subject. "The Mississippi carries into the Gulf of
Mexico every year seven and a half billion cubic
feet of soil; enough to cover Long Island two
inches deep every year."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" repeated the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>"We can do one of two things," said Ralph sagely,
"We can follow in the footsteps of China and let
the land go to ruin; or we can follow the example
of Germany, take care of our forests&mdash;or what is
left of them&mdash;and plant new ones. It is one of
the greatest questions in this country to-day, and
you are going to hear a lot about it before you are
twenty-one."</p>

<small>LUMBER: NO. 2</small></h2>


<p>The lumber business ranks fourth in the great
industries of the United States. The Department
of Forestry at Washington estimates
that we are using three times as much wood
yearly as the annual growth of the forest.</p>

<p>A grand total of 150,000,000,000 board feet of
lumber for all purposes, including firewood, is the
estimated amount, a figure the mind can hardly
grasp.</p>

<p>The railroads of our country rest on 1,200,000,000
ties. The average life of a tie is about ten years,
so that we must replace one tenth, or 120,000,000,
each year. As the average forest produces two
hundred ties to the acre, this item alone calls for
half a million acres of woods every year.</p>

<p>The tie is only one item in the great business
of railroading, immense quantities of lumber being
required for trestles, platforms, stations, bridges, etc.,
so that a full million of acres must be cut annually
to keep our railroads operating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>Place this item against the fifteen million burned,
and the statement may be made that we burn enough
each year to supply the railroads for fifteen years.
To offset this loss several railroad companies are
now planting trees for a future supply, as the many
attempts to supplant the wooden tie with a manufactured
one have not been very successful.</p>

<p>The six thousand mines of various kinds within
our border use up 5,000,000,000 board feet every
year, and so on through the list of wood-consuming
industries. As our population doubles, the consumption
of lumber quadruples. To-day, five
hundred feet of wood is used annually for every
man, woman, and child, as compared with the sixty
feet used in Europe. Already our many industries
are beginning to feel the shortage, and prices constantly
go up.</p>

<p>Turpentine, which is made from the Southern
yellow pine, requires a new "orchard" of 800,000
acres yearly to keep up the demand; and when we
realize that one third of the lumber cut is yellow
pine, it is little wonder that the price of turpentine
and other naval stores keeps moving upward.</p>

<p>Where and when will it stop? We read a great
deal about the transformation of water power into
electrical energy, but the flow of streams is dependent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>on forests, and the spring floods are followed by
drought. While the Ohio River rises forty feet in
the spring, it is possible to walk over the river bed
almost dry shod the following summer.</p>

<p>We hear much about irrigation, but irrigation is
dependent largely on mountain forests.</p>

<p>So a burning question has arisen in these United
States, called conservation, or the husbanding of
the great resources that have made our country
what it is.</p>

<p>The forest resources are different from those of
the mines. There is a definite end to the supply of
coal, iron, gold, and silver, but by proper care the
forest may be made to yield a continuous crop of
lumber.</p>

<p>Forestry does not mean the fencing in of the woods,
but the handling of them in such a way that no
more is cut than the annual growth. This has been
practised in Germany on scientific principles with
such success that the production has been increased
300 per cent., and where seventy-five years ago they
obtained twenty cubic feet from each acre a year,
they now cut sixty, and the forest continues to grow
luxuriantly.</p>

<p>What Germany has done we can do, and millions
of acres now useless can be made to yield large quan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>tities
of wood while continually clothed with growing
forests.</p>

<p>The cutting of lumber is usually done when the
sap is dormant, preferably in the winter. The logs
are gotten to the mill by the cheapest method, which
usually consists in floating them down a stream or
river; but now that most of the remaining forest
is remote, it is quite common to have portable
mills transported into the woods where the trees are
cut and sawed into planks or the larger sizes of timber
and from there loaded on the cars.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned method was more picturesque,
and the "drive" started with the breaking up of
the ice in the spring. Thousands and hundreds of
thousands of logs were guided down stream, pulled
off shore when they became stranded, and the jams
were broken up until the smooth water below made
sorting possible.</p>

<p>As several companies might be driving down the
same stream, each log was marked by an axe with
the private mark of the one to which it belonged.
After many vicissitudes, the drive would reach the
sorting boom, where the lumber of the various companies
would be separated and made up into rafts.</p>

<p>A boom is a chain of logs fastened together by
iron chains, and extending into the river. It may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>reach clear across, or one end can be anchored in
the stream to allow a passage for boats. In that
case the river end has to be anchored up stream to
catch the logs.</p>

<p>One of the most serious things encountered on a
drive is the log jam. It may be caused in many ways
but usually by some obstruction, as a shoal, rocks,
a narrowing of the river, etc.</p>

<p>The lumberman has a vocabulary of his own, and
he recognizes several kinds of jams, such as wing
jams, solid jams, etc.</p>

<p>No matter how caused, it is the business of the
lumber jack to break up the jam, and sometimes before
it can be done a late freeze will occur and the
whole mass become solid ice and logs. It is sometimes
necessary to use dynamite to break it up. The
breaking up is a dangerous time for the driver, who
must sometimes run for his life across the moving
mass of logs to the shore.</p>

<p>After they are made into rafts, steamers are used
to tow the logs to the various mills. It is slow work,
but when the destination is reached, the real process
of converting the tree into lumber begins. Often
the rafts stay in the water for months before being
broken up, and the logs guided to the endless chain
which drags them up into the mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>From this time on the action is very rapid. The
modern mill is a mass of rapidly moving machinery,
guided and controlled by comparatively few men.
Three distinct classes of saws are used&mdash;circular,
band, and gang saws, and different mills in the same
neighborhood use different methods.</p>

<p>Band saws are continuous bands of steel, often
48 feet long, and as wide as 8 inches, which pass
over two large wheels like a belt. Gang saws are
straight and move up and down rapidly. A number
of them are fastened to horizontal pieces, the
distance apart being adjustable to the thickness of
timber desired.</p>

<p>Before passing through the gang saw, the logs are
usually edged, <i>i. e.</i>, a slab is cut from two opposite
sides. The log is then turned over on one of these
flat sides, so that as it passes through the gang saw
the planks are all the same width.</p>

<p>The slabs or edgings are passed through other
saws and cut to the width and length of a lath, all
the waste possible being made into lath or other
by-products.</p>

<p>As we use four billions of lath a year, this is an
important item.</p>

<p>The process varies with the kind of lumber and its
future purpose, but a great deal is wasted in many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>mills. The refuse is used for fuel, and in some cases
burned in stacks built specially for the purpose of
getting rid of it. This is one of the forms of waste
which will undoubtedly be done away with in the
future, and already many lumbermen are at work
on the problem. The sawdust is conveyed directly
to the furnaces under the boiler and used in the
generation of steam.</p>

<small>LUMBER: NO. 3</small></h2>


<p>Having finally reached the commercial
stage, the lumber is shipped away from
the mill either by water or by rail to the
lumber yards of the country.</p>

<p>Here it should be seasoned. In the past this
process consisted of piling the planks in the open air
in such a way that air could circulate freely through
the pile, allowing the sap to evaporate and the wood
to dry evenly. This was a sure but slow process,
and in the hurry of modern life quicker methods
have been tried.</p>

<p>One of these is known as kiln drying, by which
the time is reduced to a few weeks. It consists
of piling the wood in a room like a kiln and drying
it by artificial heat. The result is not so satisfactory
as the natural method, because the sap near
the surface hardens and prevents the inner moisture
from escaping, so that kiln-dried lumber while dry
at the surface is "green" inside. When planed
till part of the surface is removed the green wood is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>brought near to the air again, and warping is liable
to occur.</p>

<p>Other methods have been tried, such as steaming
to vaporize the sap, and soaking in hot water for
the same purpose. Of course these processes all
add to the cost of lumber, yet so valuable is time that
it is difficult to obtain good old-fashioned seasoned
wood unless it has lain for some time in a local
yard.</p>

<p>In order to understand the phenomena of warping,
shrinkage, checking, shakes, etc., it is necessary
to know something of how the tree grows. Like
all living organisms, it is made up of minute cells.
The new cells are formed on the outside of the tree
under the bark, and here the sap is most active.
The cause of the flow of sap is not very clearly
understood, but it corresponds to blood in the human
body, in that it carries the nourishment that forms
the cells. As a new mass or layer of soft new cells
forms each season, the layers may be distinctly
seen and counted, but the line of separation is not
a sharply drawn one, as we find by examining a
cross section of wood with the microscope. However,
the layers or annual rings are distinct enough
to be counted, so that the age of the tree at the time
it was cut down may be readily discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>The new or sap wood, then, is further from the
centre each year, and while the old cells may
not be dead, they contain less and less sap, are
therefore drier, and after a few years change colour,
becoming darker.</p>

<p>There is often a very great contrast between the
colour of the heart wood and that of the sap wood,
although the latter may be represented by several
years of growth.</p>

<p>These annual rings are not actually circular, but
very irregular, and often wider in some parts than
in others. The study of these rings is very interesting,
and it shows that the tree usually increases in
diameter more rapidly during the first few years
than later. Very often, after growing slowly for
several years, the tree will apparently grow rapidly
again. The cause of this cannot be determined
without a knowledge of the tree's history.</p>

<p>It has been proved by experiment that thinning
the forest increases the growth of the remaining
trees 18 per cent., and these peculiarities in
the rings may have been due to some like cause.
The bearing of this fact on the peculiarities of warping
and shrinkage is that when cut down the log
is drier at the heart and more sappy at the outside,
so that evaporation occurs near the surface.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
The effect of it is shown in <a href="#fig239">Fig. 239</a>. The outside
drawing together has opened the wood, or "checked"
it, most at the outside, diminishing toward the centre.
The evaporation would have occurred just the same
had the log been cut into planks, causing them to
curl as shown at <i>a</i>. This is known as warping,
and it is one of the troubles of the woodworker.
In construction it must be constantly guarded
against, and overcome as far as possible. It cannot
be entirely prevented, but if the wood has been
well seasoned before it is used a large part of the
warp will be taken out in the planing mill, or in
the squaring up.</p>

<p>Twisting, winding, and warping are also caused
by the two sides of a board having been subjected
to different degrees of heat, moisture, etc. If a
plank is laid on the floor, the upper part is more
exposed to the air and to changes of temperature
and humidity; therefore it curls.</p>

<p>If a board is stood on end or placed in a rack
where there is a free circulation of air, the curling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>will be much less. Even in a rack, if several boards
are piled one on another, the top one will have different
conditions from the others and be apt to curl
or wind.</p>

<p>Shrinkage is a term applied to the decrease in
diameter of the tree, due to sap evaporation.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 240. Effect of shrinkage on lumber</div>

</div>

<p>In the case of the board it means a decrease in
width, and it varies greatly in different trees and
their woods. As shrinkage is always across the
grain, its effect on a
common joint may be
illustrated in <a href="#fig240">Fig. 240</a>.
At <i>a</i> is shown a middle
lap joint just put
together. If the wood
is not well seasoned, shrinkage will in time change
it to the form shown at <i>b</i>, which is exaggerated to
make the meaning clear.</p>

<p>A square piece of timber, one corner of which is
the centre of the tree, will change from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>.
Shrinkage as well as warping must be taken into
consideration in construction.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 241. The development of the panelled door</div>

</div>

<p>The development of the panelled door is a good
illustration. Suppose we wish to close a space
with a door, knowing little about shrinkage. Let
us construct it by the simplest method, say four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>vertical boards. If the width of these boards equals
the opening when the door is built (<a href="#fig241">Fig. 241</a>) there
will soon be an opening wide enough for the fingers
to enter and lift up a latch on the inside. The door
is very much of a failure. We notice, however, that
there is no opening at top or bottom. An idea!
We construct a door with planks placed horizontally.
Now although we find after a while no opening at
the sides we do find openings at top and bottom.
The panelled door is not constructed solely for
beauty but to overcome shrinkage as far as possible.
<a href="#fig241">Fig. 241</a> shows the various parts. The rails maintain
the width, the only shrinkage being in the cross
grain of the stiles, and they preserve the height
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>except for the small amount in the rails. The remaining
spaces are panelled, the construction being
shown at <i>a</i>. Both stiles and rails have a groove
plowed out to receive the edges of the panel. This
should be free to shrink in the grooves, where it
is invisible, but if the mistake is made of fastening
the panel edges rigidly in these grooves the panel
will shrink anyway and frequently split from top
to bottom.</p>

<p>Many other forms of construction which we have
seen daily as long as we can remember have equally
sound reasons for their form. No piece of woodwork
should be designed without considering how it will
be affected by shrinkage and warping.</p>

<p>In selecting lumber always look out for "shakes."
This is a defect caused by the separation of the
annual rings. A tree may be considered as a series
of irregular cylinders of diminishing diameters.
The forest-grown tree is much more spindling, tall,
and straight than the low-crowned, heavy-branched
specimen grown in the open, where there is no
crowding.</p>

<p>The swaying of the forest tree in the wind, especially
when its neighbours have been cut down,
is sometimes sufficient to make the rings separate
and slide one within the other. This is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>noticeable in some species than others and it gives the
wood a serious fault. (<a href="#fig239">Fig. 239</a>).</p>

<p>"Winding" is the result when the ends and sides
are no longer parallel. Like all peculiar characteristics
of wood, this varies greatly in lumber of various
kinds, and may be largely avoided by exposing
both sides to the same conditions, or keeping equally
distributed weight on it until used. When winding
becomes excessive, the board is useless for any kind
of work.</p>

<small>LUMBER: NO. 4</small></h2>


<p>The woods of the United States are classified
roughly as hard and soft; and
trees as broad-leaved or deciduous, and
evergreen or coniferous.</p>

<p>In a general way, the trees which drop their
leaves in the fall&mdash;the broad-leaved&mdash;produce
hard woods and the evergreens soft woods. There
are so many exceptions, however, that the rule is
a very rough guide.</p>

<p>Several of the coniferous trees drop their leaves
or needles in the fall, like the larch or tamarack,
and some woods from evergreens are harder than
some woods from broad-leaved trees. Yellow pine
is harder than basswood, which, according to the
rule, should be a hard wood. As a matter of fact,
it is softer than the majority of woods cut from evergreens.
The only way to gain a comprehensive
knowledge of this interesting subject is by experience
and study. Making a collection of woods, leaves,
and seeds is one of the most fascinating studies a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>boy can take up. He will soon discover that not
only is every wood different from every other wood
in grain, colour, odour, and hardness, but some woods
are strong and elastic, others strong and brittle,
weak, etc., and that every tree has a different leaf,
bark, flower, and seed from its neighbour. He will
find groups or families, such as the oaks, the maples,
the pines, spruces, cedars, etc., with several members
of each group, all different, yet having family
characteristics. He will be surprised at the endless
extent of the subject; the willow for instance has a
hundred and fifty known varieties. He will find
himself, like our boys, dipping into botany and
geology to discover perhaps, as Harry did, that the
oak was once an evergreen, and that it still holds
a good proportion of its leaves all winter.</p>

<p>He will learn that there are broad-leaved evergreens
like the laurel and rhododendron; that some
trees are evergreen in the South, and lose their
leaves in the North; that some shrubs of the Northern
states become trees farther south. He may even
wrestle with the problem "What is a tree?" or,
"Where does the shrub leave off and the tree begin?"</p>

<p>The study of the many methods nature has devised
for distributing seeds has evolved whole volumes;
so has the question of how the buds on the trees are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>protected in winter. There are definite ways in
which the tiny leaves are folded up in these winter
buds, all ready to unfold in a certain way in the
spring. Perhaps the reader wonders what all this
has to do with woodwork, but to a boy who once
begins to collect specimens, it will follow as a matter
of course. Knowing something about woods he
naturally begins to study trees, and gradually
observes the wonderful phenomena of growth,
flower, and seed. Planting seeds to see how they
grow is the next step, and before long he has a young
nursery in the yard; while the reading of the work
of such men as Luther Burbank will induce him to
try his hand at grafting and budding.</p>

<p>The man who makes two apples grow where one grew
before is as valuable a citizen as the man who makes
two blades of grass grow in the place of one. When
Mr. Burbank converts the prickly cactus into a thornless
cactus, valuable as a forage plant, he is conferring
a great benefit on the whole race by making millions
of acres of desert land available for stock raising.</p>

<p>Incidentally, these wonders performed by the
Wizard of California will not die with Mr. Burbank,
but will constitute the beginning of a new profession
which, combined with forestry, will offer a tempting
field for the rising generation.

<h3>COMMON TIMBER TREES AND THEIR WOOD<br />

<br />EVERGREENS OR CONIFEROUS TREES</h3>

<p><i>White Pine.</i>&mdash;One of our most beautiful evergreens.
Growing throughout the North-eastern
and Lake states, and formerly forming dense forests
from the Bay of Fundy to Minnesota. Needles
grow in groups of five of a light bluish green from
three to four inches long. Seeds are "winged" and
grow in cones five or six inches long protected by
the scales. Cones mature at end of second season.
Wood soft, light coloured, free from sap, easily
worked and used in many trades, for pattern making,
various parts of houses, toys, crates, boxes, etc.
Becoming very scarce, owing to the destruction
of the great forests. On the Pacific coast its place
in construction is taken by the sugar pine and other
woods.</p>

<p><i>Yellow and Georgia Pine.</i>&mdash;Two trees whose
wood is frequently confounded by the woodworker.
Georgia pine is a tree with very long needles, from
twelve to fifteen inches, and in groups of three.
Cones from six to ten inches. A southern tree
found from Texas to Virginia. The tops of the
young trees, like green fountains, are used in many
places as Christmas decorations. Wood hard and
resinous, used for flooring, interior finish, and decks.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Yellow Pine.</i>&mdash;A southern tree with needles in
groups of two, sometimes three, about three inches
long. Cones small, about two inches. Wood hard
and used for the same purposes as Georgia pine.</p>

<p><i>Red Pine, Norway Pine, Canadian Pine.</i>&mdash;Three
names for the same tree. Grows throughout the
North, from Nova Scotia to western Minnesota.
Cut principally in Canada. Needles, two in a
group, about five inches long. Cones about two
inches long, mature the second season. Wood
reddish in colour, hard, and used for piles, spars,
bridges, etc.</p>

<p><i>Pitch Pine.</i>&mdash;A name locally given to several
different trees. The wood is soft, brittle, resinous,
and is used for fuel and for making charcoal, rarely
for rough building. Needles in groups of three
and three to five inches long. Sometimes called
scrub pine, although it often reaches a height of
fifty to sixty feet. The cones, two or three inches
long, often remain on the tree for years. It is the
tree found along the Atlantic coast from Maine
to Georgia, growing in sand, in swamps, and among
rocks. To be recommended for its persistence
in living under the most trying conditions, even if
its wood is not very valuable.</p>

<p>In the construction of a frame house several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>kinds of wood are needed. First, the framework of
rough-sawed spruce. Second, a better wood, like
white pine, for door and window frames. Third,
the outside covering. This may be clapboards, for
which nothing has ever approached white pine, although
it is necessary now to find substitutes.
The roof, if shingled, may be of cedar, or cypress&mdash;some
spruce is used to-day. For interior work,
floors may be spruce, white pine, cypress, yellow
pine, or hard woods. For finish or trim, many woods
are used such as white wood, oak, yellow pine,
cypress, cherry, and bay wood.</p>

<p><i>Spruce.</i>&mdash;This wood has been used almost exclusively
in the past for framing, but great inroads
have been made in the supply, especially by the
manufacturers of paper pulp. Consequently the
cost is increasing rapidly.</p>

<p>Three varieties are recognized, white, black, and
red. White spruce is a distinctly northern tree,
delighting in the cold climate of Canada, but dipping
down along the Maine coast. It is a beautiful,
straight, and tall specimen, frequently found as
high as a hundred and fifty feet. The needles are
only three quarters of an inch, or less, in length and
clothe the twigs in an entire circle. Cones two inches
long, bearing under their scales tiny winged seeds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>It is used often as an ornamental evergreen for
lawns, and for this purpose probably has no equal,
as, unlike the Norway spruce, it holds its foliage,
dense and green, close to the ground.</p>

<p>The wood is weak, knotty, and soft, but suitable
for rough framing.</p>

<p><i>Black Spruce.</i>&mdash;Another northern tree, rarely
found in forests below the Canadian border, except
around the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Leaves about same size as in white spruce, but
cones smaller, more oval in form, and one inch and
a half long.</p>

<p>Spruce gum is obtained from this tree, which has
a more pleasant odour than white spruce.</p>

<p>Wood used for pulp making, framing, and,
quartered, for sounding-boards of musical instruments.</p>

<p><i>Red Spruce.</i>&mdash;A close relative of the black and
sometimes confused with it, but it is a distinct tree,
reaching its best development several hundred
miles south of the black spruce, in the Appalachian
Mountains, and extending as far south as North
Carolina; while the black variety barely crosses
the borders of Canada into Maine.</p>

<p>Needles about half an inch long. Cones small,
sometimes barely an inch and a half. They fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>the first winter, while those of the black remain on
the tree often for years.</p>

<p>Wood is similar to black spruce but lighter in
weight. Used for pulp, framing, and sounding-boards.</p>

<p><i>Hemlock.</i>&mdash;The most dainty of the eastern evergreens,
with little cones about three quarters of an
inch long, and needles half an inch. Found throughout
the country east of the Mississippi and in some
sections used for Christmas decorations.</p>

<p>A slow growing tree with wood of little value,
being brittle, light, and difficult to work, as it has
a crooked grain and is liable to splinter. The tree
makes up in beauty what it lacks as a timber producer
and its bark is rich in tannin.</p>

<p><i>Larch, Tamarack or Hackmatack.</i>&mdash;Local names for
the same tree. Drops all its needles in the fall, like
a broad-leaved tree, but the beauty of the brilliant
new green needles in the spring is a sight worth
going miles to see.</p>

<p>Found from the Lake states north to the Arctic
Circle. Needles an inch long. Cones from one half
to three quarters.</p>

<p>Wood is heavy, hard and strong. Used in ship
building, for telegraph poles, posts, and ties.</p>

<p><i>Fir, Balsam Fir, Balsam.</i>&mdash;On all firs the cones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>stand upright on the branches, while on spruces
they hang down. As these two trees are often
intermingled, this is an easy way to distinguish them.
The needles of the firs are also blunt, while those
of the spruces are sharply pointed.</p>

<p>This is the so-called Christmas tree and balsam
pillows are made from its needles.</p>

<p>Needles about three quarters of an inch long,
cones almost black in colour, from two to four
inches long.</p>

<p>Wood of little value, being soft and weak.</p>

<p>The sap in the form of gum called Canada balsam
is used in medicine, and is obtained from blisters
on the bark or by cutting the bark.</p>

<p><i>Southern Cypress, Bald Cypress, Deciduous
Cypress.</i>&mdash;Found growing naturally in the swamps
of the South, but will grow in drier soil, if planted
in the North. Several fine specimens in the parks
of Philadelphia, New York, and Brooklyn. The
lower part broadens out near the ground into a
conical base and in its native swamps the roots
send up peculiar formations known as cypress
knees.</p>

<p>Leaves very delicate and feathery, not often over
half an inch long, cones round and an inch in diameter.
Drops its needles like the larch each fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>Wood very durable in damp situations, valuable
for flooring and interior finish.</p>

<p><i>Red Cedar.</i>&mdash;The common cedar of the United
States, found in all sections where trees can grow
at all, in sand, swamp, rocky hillside, and abandoned
farm. Reaches its greatest height in the South.</p>

<p>Wood of beautiful colour and grain, soft and not
strong, easily worked, but inclined to brittleness.
Used in many trades; it furnished in the past the
only wood for lead pencils. Owing to its scarcity,
substitutes are now being tried. Very durable in
contact with water and soil. Used extensively for
posts, small boats, cooperage, ties, chests, and interior
finish.</p>

<p>Foliage difficult to describe, being sharp and awl-shaped
in the young trees, changing in later years
to a flat scale shape. Very often both forms are
found on the same tree. Seeds are the common
cedar berry, pale green in colour, about a quarter of
an inch long, each berry containing two or three
seeds. These are liked by the birds and they are
dropped along fences frequently, so that in a few
years the fences become lined with young cedar
trees.</p>

<p><i>White Cedar.</i>&mdash;Found in swamps along the Atlantic
and Gulf coasts. Has a more delicate foliage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>than red cedar, and, growing in dense thickets, is
apt to be taller and straighter.</p>

<p>The wood is light brown in colour, soft, weak, and,
like red cedar, durable in moist situations. Used
for making shingles, for boat-building, and for the
same general work as the red variety.</p>

<p><i>Arbor Vit&aelig;</i>&mdash;called in many sections white cedar.
It is an entirely different tree from the real white
cedar, having decidedly flattened and very aromatic
foliage. Used a great deal for hedges before the
days of the California privet. Seed borne in a tiny
cone half an inch long.</p>

<p>Large quantities are cut in the Maritime Provinces
of Canada to be made into shingles. Grows
sixty feet high and two feet or more in diameter.
<i>Arbor vit&aelig;</i> means tree of life, and as the bark
and young twigs were at one time used medicinally,
that may have been the origin of the name.</p>

<p>Wood is light, soft, coarse-grained, but, like the
cedars, durable. Used for ties, posts, and shingles.</p>

<h2><a name="LVI" id="LVI">LVI</a><br />
<br />
<small>BROAD-LEAVED TREES</small></h2>

<p>The broad-leaved trees are more numerous
as to varieties than the evergreens, and
from the standpoint of leaf forms may be
divided into three groups:</p>

<p>1. Trees bearing simple leaves.</p>

<p>2. Trees bearing compound leaves.</p>

<p>3. Trees bearing doubly compound leaves.</p>

<p>The first group is the largest, including as it does
such large families as the maples, oaks, willows,
poplars.</p>

<p>The second group comes next with the well-known
walnuts, hickories, ashes, and buckeyes.</p>

<p>The third group is very small, there being but
three well-known trees bearing doubly compound
leaves: the honey locust, Kentucky coffee tree,
and Hercules Club.</p>

<p>The three forms are shown at <a href="#fig242">Fig. 242</a>.</p>

<p>The leaf ends at the bud growing at the end of
the leaf stem. All above this bud constitutes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>leaf, no matter what its shape or size, and falls
in the autumn, with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>The small leaflets on the compound leaf are simply
parts of a leaf, not separate leaves, as there are no
buds at the point where they join the stem. The
arrangement of these leaflets varies. In the buckeye
and horse chestnut they radiate from a common
point, while in the locust they are in parallel rows
on opposite sides of the stem.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 242. Three types of leaves</div>

</div>

<p>In doubly compound leaves the leaflets are themselves
compound, making the whole leaf very large,
those of the Kentucky coffee tree being three feet
in length.</p>


<h3>THE MAPLES</h3>

<p>Probably the best known and most common trees,
especially in towns and cities. Most of them grow
quickly and therefore become valuable as shade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>trees. They do not make the most permanent
trees, however, and should be planted in alternation
with oaks, or other long-lived trees, for permanent
shade.</p>

<p>The seeds of all maples are winged, which helps
their distribution over large areas, in the same
manner as the seeds of evergreens.</p>

<p><i>Sugar or Rock Maple.</i>&mdash;The most valuable timber
tree of the group, its wood being heavy, hard, strong,
and close-grained. Very light in colour and valuable
for flooring and interior finish, furniture, tool
handles, and bench tops.</p>

<p>It grows throughout the Eastern states, but not
in all soils. Very rapid in growth, so much so that
in the dense forest stands, when a portion of the
woods has been cut down, the young saplings cannot
always withstand the wind pressure and are blown
down. Reaches a height in the forest of a hundred
and twenty feet, but in the open is broader and more
symmetrical. Too much cannot be said in praise
of this tree. Its shade is dense and its autumn
colouring superb. The sap yields maple syrup and
sugar, and, finally, after it has done its work
and is cut down, its wood yields lumber of the
highest value, while the limbs make excellent firewood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>The process of making maple sugar was learned,
historians tell us, from the Indians. This is probably
why the process was for two or three centuries
very crude. Holes are bored in the tree in the late
winter, as soon as the sap is brought to life by the
sun, usually in March, but the time depends upon
the weather. Spigots are placed in the holes and
pails hung under them to catch the sap. When full,
they are emptied into large kettles or boilers over a
fire, and the sap simply boiled down to the proper
consistency.</p>

<p>As the lumberman is making heavy inroads into
the maple groves or forests, the price of maple
sugar is likely to continue going up, until real
maple sugar will be only a memory, unless we wake
up from our dream of unlimited resources to the
real facts and do something.</p>

<p><i>Silver Maple, White Maple, Soft Maple.</i>&mdash;A very
common shade tree in our towns and cities. Its
natural section is along the Mississippi, where it
becomes a great tree, often a hundred feet high; but
it is so easily adaptable to new conditions, grows
so quickly from seed, and will stand so much hard
usage that it has been very popular. There are
many better trees, but this is cheap and quick growing,
and in our hurried American life we build very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>often for the immediate future and forget the next
generation.</p>

<p>Its foliage, when not blackened and spoiled by
the smoke of the city, is a beautiful dark green above,
and light silvery green below. The winged seeds
ripen in June, may be planted before July 1st,
and will produce young trees nearly a foot high
before frost of the same season. Wood not as hard
as rock maple, but strong, close-grained and brittle.
Used to some extent in cabinet work. The winter
buds are very precocious and start into life at the
first sign of spring.</p>

<p><i>Red or Swamp Maple.</i>&mdash;Found in wet places
naturally, but it makes a large and satisfactory shade
tree in heavy upland soil. The leaf form is somewhat
like that of the silver maple, but smaller.</p>

<p>Seeds ripen before summer. The flowers are red,
the leaf stems are red, and the foliage is not only the
most brilliant red of all our autumn colours, but it is
the first to give notice by its change of the approach
of winter. It is easy to see where it got its name.</p>

<p>Wood is light in colour, similar to that of the
silver maple, hard, strong, and brittle.</p>

<p><i>Sycamore Maple.</i>&mdash;Although frequently planted
in this country as a shade tree it is, like the Norway,
imported from Europe.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Moosewood, Mountain Maple, and Box Elder</i> are
three small American maples which can hardly be
placed among timber trees, except possibly the
last. Box elder or ash-leaved maple has the distinction
of having a compound leaf.</p>

<p>Its wood is soft and of more value to the pulp
maker than the lumberman. It is very hardy and
has been used on the Western prairies, where more
particular trees do not thrive.</p>


<h3>THE OAKS</h3>

<p>Perhaps as a family this group of trees is more uniformly
valuable than any other found in North
America.</p>

<p>They represent all that is the best among trees,
being strong, hardy, long-lived, and valuable as
timber.</p>

<p>There are oaks in Europe a thousand years old,
but of course we have no records that go back so far.</p>

<p>It is a difficult tree to kill, because, when cut
down or burned, a large number of healthy shoots
grow from the stump or roots, and make a rapid
second growth. The bark of all oaks contains
tannin, and in the past our principal supply came
from these trees. The old-fashioned method was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>to fell the tree, strip off the bark and leave the wood
on the ground to decay. Oak lumber is now so
valuable that this waste has been largely stopped.</p>

<p><i>White Oak Group.</i>&mdash;The oaks all bear simple
leaves which vary greatly. They may be divided
into two groups. The white oak group all bear
leaves with rounded lobes, no bristles, and ripen
their acorns the first fall after blossoming. They
rarely bear acorns before the age of twenty years.
The second group has pointed lobes, each lobe ending
in a bristle and do not ripen their acorns until
the end of the second season.</p>

<p>Among the first group are the white oak proper,
post or iron oak, mossy cup, chestnut oak, and swamp
white oak. In the second group are the red, pin,
scarlet and black oak, black jack, shingle, willow,
and Spanish oaks.</p>

<p><i>White Oak.</i>&mdash;One of the most common and best
known members of the family, slow growing, sturdy,
hardy, and beautiful. Acorns sweet compared with
others. Leaves six to eight inches long, turning
to beautiful shades of red in the fall, finally to a
brown, and a large proportion remaining on all winter.</p>

<p>This tree is little affected by temporary weather
changes. In the latitude of New York spring may
have come and the maples be in full leaf, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>white oak shows no sign. Lawns are mowed, and
finally, about June 1st, out come the oak leaves,
steadily growing without regard to late cold snaps
or hot days. During the summer a prolonged
drought occurs. The leaves of the maple turn
yellow and fall. Not so the oak; it goes right on
about its business of growing green leaves and
acorns, until the appointed time in the fall.</p>

<p>The maple leaves have all fallen and the trees
are ready for winter.</p>

<p>The oak goes right on, as steadily as a clock,
doing its work, apparently oblivious to such insignificant
things as weather changes.</p>

<p>This is the character of the tree throughout&mdash;steady,
reliable, and strong.</p>

<p>The wood is hard, durable, and valued in many
trades. The best barrels for tight cooperage are
made of it. Floors and interior trim, furniture,
cabinet work, ship building, and the making of farming
implements and wagons are all more or less
dependent on it. The mission style of furniture
is made almost exclusively from it; so is office
furniture. Quartered oak is a form of lumber obtained
by a special method of cutting.</p>

<p>In most trees when cut into lumber may be seen
a series of lines radiating from the centre, and run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>ning
in almost straight lines to the outside. They
are called medullary rays, and are much more in
evidence in some woods than others. They are
particularly noticeable in oak. These rays are
plates of flattened cells, and are usually much harder
than the rest of the wood.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="fig243"></a><img src="images/fig243.jpg" width="200" height="195" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 243. Four methods of quartering</div>

</div>

<p>The object of quartering oak is to bring these
rays to the surface of the board at as small an angle
as possible, so that they will spread over the surface
and give an added beauty to the grain. This is
accomplished in one way by
cutting the boards radially as
shown in <a href="#fig243">Fig. 243</a> (<i>a</i>). There
is much waste in this method,
and other methods less wasteful,
but not as satisfactory, from
the beauty standpoint, are shown
at <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mossy Cup or Bur Oak.</i>&mdash;So called from the form
of the cup of the acorns. It ends in a heavy fringe
which nearly covers the acorn proper&mdash;hence the
name mossy cup.</p>

<p>The leaf somewhat resembles the white oak,
having rounded lobes but a different outline.</p>

<p>Wood is hard, heavy, and strong, and is used for
the same purposes as white oak. Found throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>the country east of the Rocky Mountains, but
reaches its greatest development in the Ohio Valley.</p>

<p><i>Chestnut Oak.</i>&mdash;Found from Maine to Alabama
and west to Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Wood heavy, hard, strong, tough, close-grained
and durable in contact with the soil. Bark is
strong with tannic acid. Acorn, long and oval,
sweet and a favourite with the squirrels.</p>

<p>Two or three varieties of this tree are recognized.</p>

<p><i>Post or Iron Oak.</i>&mdash;Along with the black and black
jack oaks found on bleak and sandy plains, especially
in Texas, but extends as far north as Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Leaves thick, leathery, and much darker in colour
than the white oak. Wood used for ties, fencing
and fuel.</p>

<p><i>Swamp White Oak.</i>&mdash;Eastern United States.
Favours wet localities and swamps, and reaches a
height of a hundred feet.</p>

<p>Wood about as heavy as white oak, but inclined
to check in seasoning. Used for same general
purposes as white oak. Acorns sweet and white,
about an inch long.</p>

<p><i>The Red Oak Group: Red Oak.</i>&mdash;Tree reaches a
height of a hundred and forty feet. Found from
Maine to Georgia and as far west as Kansas. Grows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>more rapidly than white oak and has smoother bark.
Acorns large with a shallow cup and very bitter.
Wood darker than white oak, of a reddish brown
colour, heavy, hard, and strong.</p>

<p>Used for furniture and interior finish. Has a
tendency to check in drying.</p>

<p><i>Scarlet Oak.</i>&mdash;Leaf more deeply indented than red
oak. A very tall and beautiful tree with wood
slightly heavier than red oak, strong and hard.</p>

<p>Acorns, like all of this group, remain on the tree
the first winter, ripening the second fall. They are
smaller than those of the red oak and the cup is not
as shallow. It encloses a third or more of the nut,
whose kernel is white. The name is taken from the
brilliant colouring of the fall foliage.</p>

<p><i>Pin Oak.</i>&mdash;Leaf form similar to scarlet oak and
often mistaken for it by the beginner, but is smaller,
and other features of the tree distinguish it. The
acorns are small, about half an inch long, with a
broad flat base, light brown and striped. The
branching habit of the tree gives it the name. The
great number of small slender branches, especially
in winter, is very noticeable. Sometimes called
swamp Spanish oak because of its fondness for
wet places. Wood brown, hard, strong, and heavier
than red and scarlet oaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>It is being planted largely now as a permanent
shade tree and grows rapidly during its earlier
years.</p>

<p><i>Black Oak, Yellow Oak.</i>&mdash;Name derived from
the bark, which is very dark. Yellow is the colour
of the inner bark, hence the second name. Foliage
varies, is thick, leathery and shiny, of a dark green
colour.</p>

<p>Acorn is smaller than the red oak and often striped.
Has yellow and bitter kernel.</p>

<p>Wood as heavy as pin oak, forty-four pounds to
the cubic foot, strong and hard.</p>

<p>Used for fuel and for a yellow dye made from the
inner bark.</p>

<p><i>Black Jack or Barren Oak.</i>&mdash;Often found in
company with the black oak on wind-swept, barren
plains. Leaf very coarse and crude in both form
and texture, having three lobes and a tapering base.
These two trees frequently mix or hybridize, and,
while not always things of beauty, they grow where
other trees cannot live and should be recommended
for their hardiness.</p>

<p>Wood even heavier than black oak, but, as the tree
is small, it is used chiefly for firewood and the
making of charcoal.</p>

<p><i>Willow Oak.</i>&mdash;Foliage resembles the weeping wil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>low.
A southern tree, but will grow as far north
as New York. Acorns ripen at end of second season,
are small, with flat, wide base and shallow cup.</p>

<p>Kernel yellow and bitter.</p>

<p>Wood reddish brown, heavy, and strong.</p>

<p>Tree is popular in the South as an interesting
shade tree.</p>

<p><i>Laurel Oak.</i>&mdash;Name derived from the leaves, which
are in shape similar to the mountain laurel, but
lack its shiny lustre. A tree of the Middle West or
Ohio Valley. Acorns, small and half enclosed by
the cup; ripen second season.</p>

<p>Wood heavy and hard, checks in drying.</p>

<p>Used for shingles and rough construction.</p>

<p>Sometimes called shingle oak.</p>

<small>TREES WITH SIMPLE LEAVES</small></h2>


<p>Beech is a beautiful tree with light gray
bark, handsome foliage and valuable hard
wood.</p>

<p>The seed is buckwheat-shaped, small and sweet.
One of our most handsome shade trees, and although
only one species is native to the United States,
nurserymen have developed special varieties known
as weeping beech and purple or copper beech. The
European beech is also frequently planted on lawns
and in parks. Its foliage is darker and has indentations
so shallow that the leaf apparently has
only a wavy outline.</p>

<p>Wood is hard, tough, fine-grained and takes a
high polish. Used for the stocks of planes, handles,
farming implements, and for some kinds of furniture.</p>

<p>The beech tree is supposed to be impervious to
lightning, and recent experiments show that it
offers considerable resistance to an electric current.</p>

<p><i>Birch.</i>&mdash;The indentations of the beech are shallow
and concave, while the birch leaf is known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>double serrate, or double toothed, the teeth being
themselves toothed. Five varieties are known in
the Eastern states, black, red, yellow, white, and
gray.</p>

<p><i>Black Birch, Sweet Birch.</i>&mdash;The tree familiar to
boys because of its aromatic bark, which contains
salicylic acid used in treating cases of rheumatism.
A large forest tree with handsome foliage, a very
fine-winged seed and valuable wood. Heavy, hard,
fine-grained, and takes a high polish. Used for
wheel hubs, and the manufacture of furniture.</p>

<p><i>Red Birch.</i>&mdash;Found in swamps and along rivers,
especially in the South. Leaves smaller than black
birch and wood much lighter in weight, but close-grained
and strong. Used for furniture and wooden
ware.</p>

<p><i>Yellow Birch.</i>&mdash;A northern tree, growing a hundred
feet high in northern New York and Canada.
Leaves similar to black birch, but its bark is very
different. The bark of the black birch is very dark,
while that of yellow birch is of a silvery, yellowish
gray, characteristic birch bark.</p>

<p>Wood heavy, hard, and similar to black birch.
Used for the same general purposes.</p>

<p><i>White Birch, Canoe Birch, or Paper Birch.</i>&mdash;Noted
for its remarkable bark. White on the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>trees, darker on old ones. Comes off in several
distinct paper-like layers. Well known to ancient
writers and used by them for paper. It contains
a resinous oil which accounts for its water-resisting
qualities so well known in the Indian birch-bark
canoe. The inner bark contains starch and in the
extreme north it is sometimes mixed with other
foods. The sap may be used for making sugar.
Wood is light brown and light weight but hard,
strong, and close-grained. Used for shoe-lasts,
fuel, and spools.</p>

<p><i>Gray Birch, Aspen-Leaved Birch.</i>&mdash;Sometimes called
white birch. The bark is white but patched with
black and does not come off in layers as readily
nor separate so easily from the wood as white birch.</p>

<p>A smaller tree with foliage that moves as freely
in the wind as the aspen.</p>

<p>Leaf form very peculiar; a long thin stem, broad flat
base, and long tapering outline, double serrate. A
persistent little tree, very hardy and difficult to kill.</p>

<p>Wood is light and soft, close-grained but weak.
Used for pulp, fuel, spools, and hoops.</p>

<p><i>Hop Hornbeam, Ironwood.</i>&mdash;A little tree with
delicate birch-like foliage and wood of great hardness.
The name hop is derived from the fruit cluster
bearing the seeds, which resembles the hop. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>bark is in remarkable contrast to the foliage, being
deeply furrowed and smooth, as if a smooth skin
were drawn over powerful muscles.</p>

<p>The wood weighs over fifty pounds to the cubic
foot, is tough, close-grained, hard and will take a
high polish. Used for mallets, tool handles, and
levers.</p>

<p><i>Hornbeam or Blue Birch.</i>&mdash;A small tree with dark
gray or bluish bark. Leaves similar to ironwood,
but narrower. Wood weighs forty-five pounds to
the cubic foot, hard and strong, similar to ironwood
and used for the same purposes.</p>

<p><i>Elm, White or American.</i>&mdash;The well-known shade
tree of the North. Leaf is lop-sided, one side being
considerably larger than the other, double serrate.
Aside from being a beautiful shade tree, the wood
is very valuable in several trades, being heavy, hard,
strong, and tough. It does not split easily and is
valued for such critical places as wheel hubs and
saddles. Used in cooperage, and supply nearly
exhausted.</p>

<p><i>Red Elm, Slippery Elm.</i>&mdash;Red from the dark
brown colour of its wood and slippery from the
character of the inner bark. The slippery elm of
commerce is made from this, which sufficiently
explains its character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>Leaves are larger, coarser, and rougher than white
elm and wood is heavy, hard, close-grained and tough.
Used for ties, fence posts, and agricultural implements.</p>

<p><i>Rock Elm, Cork Elm.</i>&mdash;Rock from the nature
of the soil it is particularly fond of&mdash;rocky cliffs
or hills&mdash;cork from the corky ridges which appear
on the branches. A valuable timber tree but found
in limited quantities. The wood is unlike the red
and white elms in that it will take a high polish.
Hard and tough, close-grained but easily worked.
Used for cabinet work, farming implements, ties,
and to some extent for bridge timbers.</p>

<p><i>Basswood, Linden.</i>&mdash;A large timber tree of the
Northern states and Canada. Its flowers are very
sweet and attract the bees to such an extent that
it is sometimes called the "bee tree." It has several
varieties, as the small-leaved linden of the South,
the silver linden, weeping silver linden, etc.</p>

<p>Leaves are heart-shaped, serrate, and lop-sided.
A valuable shade tree. Wood is soft, weak, even-grained,
does not split easily. The favourite wood
for pyrography because of its white colour, freedom
from pitch, etc. Used for boxes of wagons, wooden
ware, and to some extent for furniture making.</p>

<p><i>Holly.</i>&mdash;A broad-leaved evergreen. Leaves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>berries used as Christmas decorations. A southern
tree found as far north as Long Island. Wood very
light in colour, but hard and close-grained. Takes a
high polish. Used in cabinet work and engraving.</p>

<p><i>Cherry, Wild or Black.</i>&mdash;The cabinet wood in
common use is from this tree, although several
varieties are known to botanists. The wild cherry
of the roadside in the East, but a large forest tree
west of the Mississippi, especially from Kansas to
Texas. Wood a beautiful reddish brown, close-grained,
strong, and will take a high polish. Used
in cabinet work, interior of houses, and for car
finish.</p>

<p><i>Tulip, White Wood, Yellow Poplar.</i>&mdash;The last name
is incorrect, as the tree is not a poplar. White
wood is also inaccurate, as the only part of the wood
that is white is the sap wood. A member of the
magnolia family found throughout the East but
rare in New England. Has a peculiar leaf with four
points, smooth, shiny, and distinctive. Flowers the
size and colour of a yellow or orange-coloured tulip.
Wood greenish yellow, light, soft, brittle, free from
knots, and inclined to warp more than white pine,
for which it is now being substituted. Used for
many purposes, including cabinet work, interior
finish, panels, etc.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Sweet Gum, Red Gum, Liquid Amber.</i>&mdash;Like the
tulip, a large, handsome tree found throughout the
East. Leaves have five fingers resembling a starfish,
seeds produced in seed balls about an inch in
diameter. The seed itself is very small.</p>

<p>Wood a beautiful reddish brown with handsome
grain, heavy but soft, brittle, weak, warps and winds
badly.</p>

<p>Used to some extent in interior finish and in wood
turning.</p>

<p><i>Chestnut.</i>&mdash;The well-known tree of the East.
Wood light and open-grained, soft, but very durable
in contact with the soil, hence its use for ties and
fence posts. Has beautiful grain and takes a good
polish. Used for furniture.</p>

<p>A fungous disease is rapidly destroying this tree
in the East.</p>

<p><i>Sycamore, Buttonball, Buttonwood.</i>&mdash;Sycamore is
incorrect. This is the American plane, a near
relative of the European plane tree. Buttonball
is derived from the shape of the seed pods, which are
round, an inch or more in diameter, and stay on the
tree during the winter.</p>

<p>This is the tree which sheds part of its bark each
year, giving the trunk a mottled appearance.</p>

<p>Wood is hard and heavy, has an interesting grain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>and takes a good polish. Used for interior finish
of houses.</p>

<p><i>Poplar.</i>&mdash;A large family of trees of which nine
members are recognized in North America. All
have light and soft woods of little value except for
making boxes, packing cases and wood pulp.</p>

<p>Their value lies in hardiness, quick growth and
ability to cover burned areas so as to give a forest
cover in localities where other trees will not grow.
The balsam poplar, or balm of Gilead, formerly
planted extensively as a shade tree, reaches well up
into Alaska, and in the Yukon territory reaches a
height of a hundred feet. Immense forests cover
hundreds of square miles. As a shade tree it possesses
one or two good qualities, quick growth and an
indifference to the smoke and grime of cities. It is
otherwise not very desirable.</p>

<p><i>Dogwood.</i>&mdash;A small tree with brilliant flowers in
the spring and bright red berries in the fall. Wood
heavy, hard, tough, and close-grained. Used for
hubs of wheels, tool handles, and mallets.</p>


<h3>BROAD-LEAVED TREES WITH COMPOUND LEAVES</h3>

<p><i>Black Walnut.</i>&mdash;Found throughout the East, most
abundantly in the Mississippi Valley. Leaves
bear from fifteen to twenty-three leaflets. Nut is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>enclosed in a green husk rich in tannic acid. Wood
a beautiful dark brown, sapwood light. Heavy,
hard, strong. Takes a high polish. Used in cabinet
work, for furniture, inside finish, and for gunstocks.</p>

<p>Getting very scarce.</p>

<p><i>White Walnut or Butternut.</i>&mdash;A smaller tree than
the black walnut, the nuts being more elongated and
pointed. Both nuts and leaves have an odour
distinctive and different from the black walnut.
Wood also lighter in colour, softer but takes a good
polish. Used for interior finish and furniture.</p>

<p><i>Hickory.</i>&mdash;Nine species found in the United States.
The pecan is a hickory, also the pignut, shellbark,
etc. All have wood noted for its elasticity, toughness
and strength. It is heavy, hard and close-grained.
Used for agricultural implements, wagons,
carriages, axe handles, cooperage, and automobile
spokes.</p>

<p>The nuts of the various species vary greatly, from
the bitter pignut to the popular pecan.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i>&mdash;Several American species, all bearing wood
which is hard, strong, and elastic. Coarser in grain
and lighter in weight than hickory, hence more
valuable for oars and baskets.</p>

<p>The ash is a tall, clean-cut tree with beautiful
foliage and bears a winged seed. The wood is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>valuable for carriage work, farming implements,
furniture and is used for interior finish.</p>

<p><i>Buckeye.</i>&mdash;The American relative of the horse
chestnut, which is a European tree. Native to the
Mississippi Valley. Leaf has five or seven leaflets
radiating from the end of the stem. Nuts are
similar to the horse chestnut in colour, but not so
regular in form. Wood is light in colour and weight,
used in making wooden ware, pulp, wooden limbs,
and occasionally for buildings.</p>

<p><i>Locust.</i>&mdash;A tree belonging to the same botanical
family as the bean and pea. This is seen in its
flowers, which resemble the sweet pea and are fragrant.
Seeds are beans borne in pods, varying in
size and shape from the delicate light brown little
seed of the honey locust, to the coal-black, stonelike
seed of the Kentucky coffee tree.</p>

<p><i>Black Locust, Yellow Locust.</i>&mdash;Found from New
York south to northern Georgia and west to Arkansas.
Seed pods three or four inches long. Wood
yellow, heavy, hard and close-grained. The most
durable wood we have in contact with the soil,
used extensively for posts.</p>

<p><i>Honey Locust.</i>&mdash;Native to the Mississippi Valley,
but hardy when transplanted. Doubly compound
leaves of great delicacy. Tree has many thorns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>growing often in great clusters and sometimes six
inches long. Seeds borne in long, dark brown pods
often twisted.</p>

<p>Wood reddish brown, hard, strong, coarse-grained
and durable. Used for wheel hubs.</p>

<p><i>Kentucky Coffee Tree.</i>&mdash;Named from the fact that
the pioneers made a coffee substitute from its black
beans. A southern tree, occasionally found as far
north as New York. Leaves doubly compound.
Seeds borne in large pods shaped like a lima bean
about ten inches long.</p>

<p>Wood light brown, heavy, strong and coarse-grained.
Checks considerably in drying, but durable
and takes a good polish.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
